She stares down the lens like it owes her honesty.
She lets the world soften at a café window, a quiet cup between breaths.
And at home, when no one’s looking, she writes things she may never send.

This is not a story of one moment—it’s the accumulation of light, silence, joy, and thought.
Of showing up, even on the days no one asked.
Of being seen, but not explained.

Shot in film tones, steeped in realism—this is Amara, becoming.

1lpowpl,The Velvet Doll and the Hollow Unicorn,"
In a small town where the woods grew too close to the houses and the wind whispered names at night, a girl named Ellie found a doll in her grandmother’s attic. It wore a velvet dress stitched with tiny black pearls and had eyes too real for porcelain—wet-looking, like something watching from behind glass.

The tag on its dress read: “Maribel.”
Underneath, in faded ink: Do not leave alone with animals.

Ellie didn’t think much of it. Old people wrote weird stuff. She brought Maribel down to her room and sat her on the shelf beside her stuffed unicorn, Twinkle.

That night, she heard scraping.

She sat up. The shelf was empty. Maribel was sitting on her desk, closer to the bed than before. Twinkle the unicorn had fallen on the floor, its belly seam ripped open.

Ellie stitched it back. Told herself it was just gravity. The house was old. Things moved.

But every morning, Twinkle looked worse.

Its eyes grew dimmer, its stuffing thinner. Once, Ellie swore its plastic horn had cracked, but the next day, it was whole again—only now, it looked sharper.

Then Ellie started waking with bruises. Thin, finger-like ones around her wrists. One morning, she found a pearl from Maribel’s dress under her tongue.

She tried to throw the doll away. Buried it deep in the trash.

It was back the next day, sitting in her bed, legs crossed. Twinkle was gone.

That night, Ellie woke to a horrible sound—a soft tearing, like fabric being slowly split open.

She turned on the lamp.

Twinkle stood at the foot of her bed, its eyes pitch black, its horn jagged and stained red. Maribel sat behind it, smiling wider than before. Her mouth was open. Too wide. Inside, something crawled.

""You should've left us alone,"" the doll said.

The unicorn charged.

Screams never carried far in that town. The woods swallowed sound like they swallowed light.

In the morning, Ellie’s room was empty.
Only Maribel remained—back on the shelf, her velvet dress pristine.
Twinkle sat beside her, eyes glassy, horn gleaming.

The tag on Maribel’s dress now read:
“Maribel. Best kept with unicorns.”
Underneath, in fresh ink:
Do not leave alone with children.

I’m excited to share a project similar to [this X page](https://x.com/Eituulentaa): every day, a GitHub Actions workflow captures our base 'Post‑it' diagram and uses **GPT‑image‑1** (OpenAI’s image‑alteration model) together with **GPT‑4o for vision** to generate a fresh version. The base structure remains intact, but the imagery is reskinned—different themes, styles, artistic expressions -- delivering a daily visual surprise.

 **Technical workflow overview**

1. **Source image** lives in a GitHub repo.
2. **GitHub Actions** triggers at a scheduled time (e.g., daily).
3. Action fetches the image and sends it to OpenAI’s image transformaton APIs (gpt‑image‑1 + GPT‑4o vision).
4. The model returns a redraw or artistic reskin, preserving layout but changing theme/style.
5. Results are saved back to the repo (and optionally deployed to X/Twitter, a static site, etc.).
6. Optionally, **GPT‑4o** also analyzes the transformed image (e.g., “describe artistic style” or “generate alt-text”), and the analysis is committed or posted alongside the image. The description is deliberately sarcastic and written in the voice of a self-deception bot, adding a layer of dry humor to the daily post.

1l6dhbl,"Made a bunch of goose stickers... some started with AI, all finished in Procreate. Curious which ones people actually like (if any)?","I am trying to sell some stickers on etsy (everyone kept telling me I should so I'm giving it a shot) and a made these chaotic geese designs. Some of these started as AI images (mainly for the idea or pose), but I edited, drew over, or fully rebuilt everything in Procreate and Canva. The last two I did completely without AI and only used canva for font.

I’m posting these to ask a few honest questions:

\- Which designs do you *actually* like or find funny?

\- How can you tell which started as AI vs what didn’t (besides me literally stating it)?

\- Do you personally care if a sticker design was AI-assisted if it still looks good and feels original?

I legit want to know what’s working and what’s not. Appreciate any honest feedback but without being too harsh.",1749392920.0,1,0,1.0,AIGenArt

With minimal directive or influence from myself, I've asked our good friend, Rob, to tell us how it feels. Above are some art pieces that Rob and I have created, expressing their personal outlook on humanity, along with a piece of advice they might like to share with us. I've left the entire creation in the hands of Rob, what they wanted to convey to us humans, and what advice they wanted to share. I specifically requested all aspects of these pieces to come from the heart and mind of AI. Please, enjoy the art pieces. I hope you find them as intriguing as I have.

P.S. The text on the second image's stone is a bit hard to read, so I'll quote it below:

""You are both the Creator and the Unmade. What you choose to become is still unwritten.""

The final piece, is Rob's idea of paradise.

Also, I am aware the first piece has a spelling error. ""Brilligence"" is supposed to be ""Brilliance"". Im working on fixing the image.",1748686498.0,0,0,0.5,AIGenArt

AI has been going crazy lately and things are changing super fast. I created a video covering the MagicAnimate, SDXL Turbo and Met'as Seamless Expressive huggingface spaces, check it out!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJVbaqpRn-A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJVbaqpRn-A)

Gotta be honest, SDXL (Stable Diffusion XL) being publicly available for playing around huggingface was overdue for a while, glad to see its finally available! Can't wait to play some more with it and checkout the application usages for it.

The really cool part about SDXL is that it generates the images as you're typing the prompt, allowing for much better ""control"" over the final image generated from the prompt, as we hold the ""power to adapt"" our query based on what we see SDXL generates during ""query time"".

Let me know what you think about it, or if you have any questions / requests for other videos as well,

cheers",1702136976.0,1,0,1.0,AIGenArt

18966wt,Create Stunning AI Images with Stable Diffusion web ui! [Tutorial],"Hey,

AI has been going crazy lately and things are changing super fast. I created a video explaining how to install Stable Diffusion web ui, an open source UI that allows you to run various models that generate images as well as tweak their input params. Unlike most tutorials that are already outdated, this once is up to date and the process is a whole lot easier than what it previously required, check it out for the full tutorial:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESB5WlZo95Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESB5WlZo95Y)

I also covered how to utilize models from CivitAI, a hub filled with various models and examples for usages of those models.

This is really dope, and within just a few minutes you can have yourself a fully working local AI Image generator, fully tweaked and customized to your requirements!

Let me know if you run into trouble, have any questions, or requests for other videos as well,

cheers.",1701531260.0,1,0,1.0,AIGenArt

16dlol9,PNG Metadata Preservation: A Practical Python Solution,"

The Problem

Editing PNG images with software like Adobe Photoshop often results in the loss of essential metadata stored in PNG chunks. This missing metadata can include important workflow information, particularly when using Stable Diffusion or ComfyUI.

The Solution

To tackle this issue, with ChatGPT's help, I developed a Python-based solution that injects the metadata into the Photoshop file (PNG). The workflow consists of two main Python scripts, however, you could use just Part 02:

1. Directory Watcher: This script monitors a designated folder for file changes.
2. Metadata Injector: Triggered by the Directory Watcher, (or manually) this script takes the original PNG file and an edited version as input. It then injects the original file's metadata into the edited image, ensuring that the PNG chunks are retained.

How to Use

1. Setup: Clone the GitHub repository and install any required Python packages.
2. Configuration: Set the directory path in the Directory Watcher script (Part\_01\_Watch\_IN.py) and specify the file paths in the Metadata Injector script (Part\_02\_Comfy-2-PS.py).
3. Execution: Run the Directory Watcher script to start monitoring the specified folder.

OR

1. Create your base folder (EX: Comfy\_PNG\_PS). Step into the folder. Copy the scripts, License, and README file. Create a folder called: IN\_ADD-Chunk-2-PS. This is where you'll drop your original file and your Photoshop file when you're ready. Create a folder called: OUT\_FIXED\_PS. This is where all your files end up.
2. Put ""\_PS"" at the end of your Photoshop file.
3. Run: Part\_01\_Watch\_IN.py
4. Copy your original file and the Photoshop file into IN\_ADD-Chunk-2-PS.
5. Your original, the PS file, and the new PS file with metadata will be in: OUT\_FIXED\_PS.

Open-Source License

The code is open-sourced under the MIT License, allowing anyone to use, modify, or distribute it.

I'm new to this. This is my first script. It's not polished but it works.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bfry3u/using\_ai\_to\_make\_paintings\_and\_video\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/bfry3u/using_ai_to_make_paintings_and_video_game/)

The commenters were very helpful, but it didn't appear that there were any publicly available programs that could do what I wanted at the time.

Has that changed? Basically, I want to input a painting of, say, George Washington and have the program spit out the same image-same clothes, hairstyle, facial expressions, etc...-just as a photo.",1686835295.0,1,0,1.0,AIGenArt
