1egnacu,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Accidental art major: Digital artists STILL receive backlash. There is definitely a lot of backlash against digital art when I accidentally walked into the art department of a major university and got an art degree as a second major despite not really being an artist. 

Professors spoke wonderfully about all the new movements within modern art. We were asked to do ""appropriation"" projects where we can repurpose corporate advertising, readymade objects, etc. Some people painted extreme realism. Others melted candles and poured chemicals on wood, or put up banner signs with cutout letters. 

But digital art?

It was certainly taught. They taught Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. The program also included some multimedia prereqs as well, and we got to learn Premiere and Audition.

But was it universally praised by the professors?

One painting professor, a talented guy known for his geometric Bauhaus-esque art, didn't think using an iPad for art was particularly authentic. Another professor scolded a friend of mine for using her iPad as her primary medium. There were lectures now and then about the threat of technology and instant gratification. My last day of art class of any kind was a lecture about how technology represents a loss of empiricism, and she went over everything from nonstandard grammar to the fact that artists can thrive in online bubbles. 

Things like the ability to zoom in, use alternative color theory/palettes/wheels, undo mistakes (whatever that means to you), use any kind of procedural FX, take advantage of pen stabilization, straighten your lines, trace and remove the lower layer, and straight up photobash were often seen as lazy, despite them just being new resources, like a transpose button and sequencer on a synthesizer, or spell check and the ability to insert-type on a word processor. 

Maybe they make things easier for some, and they definitely modify the specific skill-sets that illustrators use. 

But do they mean that making art with these tools available is always easy? Hell no! 

But some would say that if the computer, tablet, or CGI render farm does anything for you, you're not doing it at all, even if your input, at the very least, influenced the output. 

People have called for banning photoshop. Some think any form of image manipulation is dishonest and should be stopped in the name of the law of Moses. Others say that even photoshop forgeries not passed off as unedited are wrong, that having this ability means the program is dangerous, or that Photoshop should be banned to prevent anorexia. Some also don't see the value that image editing and image manipulation often has, like in astrophotography. Astrophotography often exaggerates colors and details, but those exaggerations follow a pattern and make the image appreciable. A ""true color"" image just means the reds stay red, the greens stay green, and so on – but the image is brightened and often saturated. NASA does it. But what this does is make the subtle variations in color more obvious to the naked eyes. 

And image editing is a skill in its own right. 

Should the Ban Image Editing crowd get their way? 

Noise/grain reduction, while generally not trained on scraped data, is a machine learning algorithm most of the time – specifically a simple DIFFUSION algorithm, and a few people criticize it for being AI nowadays too. 

I'm a tech person. I'm pursuing an EE-related certificate as well as a CS-related one. My dream jobs include being a PCB engineer or technician. I regret not doing it sooner since tech is also a main special interest and hobby of mine – I ""accidentally"" walked into art class as a hopeful product designer who really wanted to just do EE, but didn't do it because of the irrational guilt brought on by tech stereotyped as problematic, capitalistic, and male (I'm MTNB). 

I want to keep learning about hardware AND software. Ideally, I'd code, hack, or crank out schematics and builds both on and off the clock. I think that can be art (especially the hobby work where you can bend the rules a bit). I'm personally interested in, among other things, the weighting of ML neural networks. 

I think, since a lot of older apps do advertise things like pen stabilization as ""AI,"" I can see why people who are adamantly anti-AI might be critical of that aspect of digital art. 

This is technology a lot of artists don't really understand, or even care to understand, especially since it's highly conditional stuff – pretty much any lecture on basic computer science, electrical engineering, or even basic digital media software development might sound like ""using X for Y to make Z, but sometimes X is S and Z is always A+B, but the practical applications of Z are endless, and how we arrive at Y depends on R."" There are 15 competing standards, many names made up yesterday by some intern, and it's all held together by duct tape, comments, and an unspoken agreement to not touch any functions that work, running on chip designs that have been repurposed by many people for many reasons as they have been gradually improved since the 90s at the very latest (most modern chips can be traced to '70s and '80s tech). 

People hear about ""GANs stealing data"" and think scraping data is inherent to all machine learning. People hear that some high-up AI dev ""doesn't understand AI"" and assume that means they're just guessing the whole way through, even if they (or their coworkers) understands the MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS that make everything work. 

And people hear about digital art and think it's hogwash and don't want to understand what goes into it. To them, a computer is the enigma machine of the century that does all the art for you, and it's either you doing something or the computer doing it, or someone else doing it by proxy of the computer. 

And a surprising number of people see art, music, and animation as a ""physical"" thing, as if media were a freaking olympic sport, and not a spectrum of processes, projects, and products people perform, plan, evoke, spontaneously generate, outsource, in-source, sense, and deliver, whether for their own personal amusement or to share with the whole wide world.

1cd4tnb,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Labor Theory of Value and AI art Its funny to me that so many people hate the LTV until you start talking about AI art, and the suddenly it’s about soul and “it takes no effort”.

Clearly the effort something takes ads some intrinsic value

For those not in the know: 

The labor theory of value is the idea that the worth of something, like a product, is determined by the amount of work needed to make it. So, if something takes a lot of time and effort to create, it should be more valuable than something that's easy to make.




The labor theory of value was developed by early economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo, but it is most famously associated with ***Karl Marx***.


It is widely shit on because of its association with communism. 


I’m not here to debate its merits. 


But the arguments that hand made art is worth more than AI art, which is pushed by many Capitalist artists, is highly ironic to me. Because it’s a very similar ideology to LTV. 


I find it especially amusing because I lean quite far left but I’m also pro AI and pro AI art. 

I have no problem with AI art being created, but I also have no problem with people selling their hand made art for more than AI art that is visually the same. Right now the economics just don’t make sense for artists, they can’t produce the volume of art that AI can for the price. (Not a comment on quality)

Under LTV, AI art and regular art might actually be priced similarly, it’s just that most of the work with AI art is done in the background for AI. The development of neural networks etc does the heavy lifting. 

Whereas with handmade art the work is done by the creator mostly, unless you are measuring the work of their mentors or teachers, the cost of tools etc. 



Anyway, if you think AI art is intrinsically less valuable because it takes less effort to make… well you might be more communist than you realize.

148mi4g,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"The (true) reasons why artists hate this technology I have been thinking and decide to make a short list of the actual motivations and explanations as far why I believe anti-AI artists hate this technology. Feel free to add more:

**1) They are afraid of losing their jobs**

This one is pretty obvious and pretty simple, and even understandable – you feel for them, you feel for anyone having their livelihoods threatened, but it's also the one that they most avoid addressing directly. Very few anti-AI artists until this very day, especially the most famous ones, admit ""I would be against this tech even if was developed with only licensed data"". What we have been seeing is they constantly moving the goalpost:

Don' train on data scraped out of the internet evolved into don't train on data that we uploaded to your stock photo site therefore agreeing with your TOS which will eventually evolved into: ""Disney shouldn't be allowed to train AI models on their IP because Disney animators 10, 20, 30... 90 years ago didn't consent with them having their work trained with AI"". The ""consent"" argument was fundamentally dishonest, my guess is that they – especially famous artists suing art generator companies – avoid using it up until this very day because it's also a pretty weak point: automation happens to everybody, why should artists get a pass?

**2) It was quicker than other previous automation affecting creative workers**

For example, machine translation also affected creative workers, but for a series of reasons, it evolved more slowly – progress tend to be exponential. It's like you have garbage machine translation poping up in the 1980s/1990s to somewhat descent machine translation being developed in the 2010s, more precisely in the second part of the decade, with Google debuting deep natural translation *(which indiscriminately takes data on the internet to train itself, but ludds didn't seem to care with this happens to others)*. If AI art had been evolved more gradually probably artists, much like translators, would probably have had more time to get used to, process the information and deal with such new reality.

**3) They thought they were imune to innovation**

While if you are a truck driver you probably... I won't say “*would gladly accept being replace by a machine”*, but at the very least you had this thought in the back of your mind and considered a possibility and processed that information over the years. You were humble. You had no delusions of being special, **you didn't tie your value as a human being to your skill of knowing how to drive a vehicle**, which many anti-AI artists do, and think creativity is a magic thing that only they hold they key to it, which simply isn't the case. Up to this very day you see many artists on Twitter saying something among the lines of ""They should automate menial jobs instead!"" (menial according to whom?). And which ends up bringing me to my last point:

**4) A revolt of the “intellectuals”**

It's worth to highlight, it's not only artists who might get replaced by this tech, but also journalists. And the press really like to talk about itself, and everything that happens to them, as well as their concerns, and the concerns of journalists usually take a desproportional amount of attention in the media. Which explains the much bigger exposure on this subject, which tends to amplify the outrage against such technology. In other words, now that the creative/white collar class is being threaten, this is being given much more attention than when other industries were being automated away. While when blue collar workers were getting replaced the response on media was sorta like a knee-jerk reaction such as *“They should learn how to code”*, now that the creative types were the one in the line, this gets much more media time.","the  true) reasons why artists hate this technology i have been thinking and decide to make a short list of the actual motivations and explanations as far why i believe anti-ai artists hate this technology. feel free to add more:

Corporate influence on legislation around AI has very much appeared to align with regulatory capture; restricting the development of open source or free alternatives (and thus the development of competition) to ChatGPT and similar services.

&#x200B;

With all of the options out there, I am feeling more certain than I have in the past that SCOTUS (Supreme Court in the US, where I am a citizen) as terrible as they are in 2023 would rule in opposition and overturn it.

&#x200B;

It is becoming apparent that the Republican party is a bit more open to the idea of keeping AI openly accessible than I first assumed; with the recent use of generative tech by the GOP to make a political attack ad, and some outspoken critics of the RESTRICT act being Republican politicians (Rand Paul and others), I have been surprised to see a positive take on AI from a political party I otherwise vehemently oppose.

&#x200B;

While I don't agree with that ad I mention, and I am completely against pretty much everything the GOP stands for, this still signifies there may be some protections for Open Source software that can be won at the Supreme Court level, considering the extreme partisanship of GOP justices in their alignment to party politics.

&#x200B;

If any good can be extracted from such an otherwise heinously harmful and extremist court, it is imperative that it be pursued, and with mounting pressure from Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI on a Democratic POTUS, with support from openly corrupt politicians like Pelosi and under-informed leaders like Schumer that are objectively unfit to make regulatory decisions on AI or scrutinize corrupt corporate influence on legislation on it, the Open Source community needs an updated short term strategy to address how it is to defend itself from the possibility of extreme and unexpected legal implications.  This should not be a permanent strategy, just a survival plan while AI is able to weather the next few years of grifters and corporate con artists peddling ""fire and brimstone""  AI culture (megacorps like MS/Google/OpenAI preaching the dangers of AI, pushing for restricting open sharing of it, preaching their own unsubstantiated benevolence).

&#x200B;

I don't like pushing fear, but this meeting mentioned in the article here was behind closed doors--no details shared, and only Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and a single startup corporation were invited.  Not one person from the Free Software Foundation, the EFF, or anyone representing the absolutely massive Free and Open Source Software community was given a voice here, and none of these attendees shared details.  [

&#x200B;

With all of that said, if a drastic decision that harms or destroys the open source sharing of AI/ML models and code is made, the response may need to be a class action lawsuit that escalates up to a SCOTUS ruling on the matter.

&#x200B;

I have no idea how to do this, but I do have many resources available; financial and otherwise, to viably prepare a response like this in the event that the worst case scenario unfolds and the public is stripped of Open Source access to AI related technologies.

&#x200B;

I am going to get some thoughts on this; I plan to email several influential people involved with successful cases that have upheld the GPL license to get advice on what a strategy might look like, and technical detail on the process of filing a lawsuit suit aimed at prompting a SCOTUS response, should the worst case scenario unfold.  I am also going to contact the political group involved with that ai-generated ad I mentioned to vet at least some baseline legitimacy (make sure a investor/producer from an entity that is an military adversary to the US was not involved etc) and if there is potential interest in assisting with funding the preparation of the aforementioned litigation.

I am thinking how this could be an issue in the long run, especially with stuff like ChatGPT, with all power and control in the hands of big corporations. 

So, how about a law that would force companies to OpenSource the model after X year (1-10)?

1201qgb,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"No folks, submitting an AI assisted work for review to the Copyright Office does not make someone 'Hitler' Sorry my previous post is deleted, I got the mod warning about public figures while away from my desk (and Reddit's definition of that is not that clear) but couldn't figure out how to edit the image from my phone's app.

Anyway, there's an anti-AI artist on Twitter comparing Kris Kashtanova to Hitler for trying to lawfully register their AI assisted work with the US Copyright Office, and too many others actually participating in that pile-on. I don't even think showing the censored screenshot is necessary at this point, as it's more of the same behavior from the same group of people and not hard to find. I'm just surprised at how far they're taking this now especially seeing as Kris is non-binary &amp; never displayed a shred of fascist behavior that I could see.  
Kris works with AI as ethically as they can, and I don't really care who paid an attorney to help them with the submissions, as they weren't hurting anyone by making their case and trying to get answers about copyright law for AI images from the USCO. Getting those answers can only benefit all of us regardless of which side of this we're on and since their first ruling was not even in favor of protecting individual AI images, the anti folks should be fine with these attempts or even encourage it. The USCO doesn't take bribes, they don't have judges appointed by partisan politicians or biased juries selected by either party's lawyer, they're going to make their decision based on existing copyright law and what they think is fair.  
They were brave to be the test subject like that and probably did not foresee the amount of hate they'd get for trying to get official guidance. I don't know that I would have the same sweet and calm demeanor they've shown throughout all of this drama.  
I am however glad to see that Kris gained a few thousand followers after the hate tirade directed at them, as that kind of bullying usually just makes the person doing it look bad and gives the victim of it more free publicity.

This should be a heads up as well for anyone prominently using AI image tools online to make sure and protect your private info, such as your home address and such. If you do register your eligible work with the USCO you should know that all of the physical address info is made public record on their website, so it's a great idea to get a PO Box if you can, to use for registration. Though it may look like one address field is meant to be private and the other is for people to contact you about licensing, I learned the hard way that ALL of the address info will be available online to anyone.  
It cost me $100 each to change all of mine to my PO Box &amp; I had to take out a paypal credit line since I registered a lot of them. I'd like to help anyone else avoid that issue!  
I'd also love to see the USCO change what's freely available publicly especially since hardly anyone ever uses snail mail anymore anyway, an email and phone number should be sufficient for most purposes. And with how many artists WFH, many women, there should be a way for us to stay safe from any targeted violence and still protect our work.","no folks  submitting an ai assisted work for review to the copyright office does not make someone 'hitler' sorry my previous post is deleted, i got the mod warning about public figures while away from my desk (and reddit's definition of that is not that clear) but couldn't figure out how to edit the image from my phone's app.

Hopefully this is the kind of direction AI can go in that will sway public opinion and show positive uses for AI in the arts.

So earlier this week my partner's family had the unfortunate news that her little sister would be staying in the hospital for an extended period of time. It is nothing particularly new since she was born with a very rare disorder that leads to a lot of hospital visits, but more than a day or two is rare and this time she was going to be admitted for almost a week. After a few days of the stress she was very emotional and started crying a lot.  She can't fully express herself verbally, and she has OCD, so any irregularities in her schedule are pretty devastating. Her OCD leads to an obsession with scenarios and objects, so she tends to roleplay hospital visits since they have been such a major part of her life for the past 20 years. All of her toys have played hospital with her multiple times, and she likes to make large paper cutouts of thermometers, medicine, doctors, etc. Right now one of her obsessions is for a plush lobster named Rocky.  
I got a voice message this morning saying she is very emotional and wants pictures of Rocky playing with Cuisenaire blocks (another long obsession, she calls them ""Math Rods"") since they know I work with photoshop in my career. I made something within a few minutes and sent it over, and of course she loved it. Here is my masterpiece that took about 3 minutes in total. 



Then I decided to see what I could do with AI. I have been using it since 2020 across multiple platforms so I was sure I could do something. Within a couple more minutes I had multiple high quality images that really brightened her day

So, this article caught my attention for a few reasons, but to put it shortly, it just doesn't make sense:

For starters, it doesn't say anything new that people didn't knew for the last 3 years or so. There are URLs of everything on LAION-5B. So? I'm not sure why the journalist gives this information as some breaking news or as if something that target kids or brazilian kids specifically .

There are no ""news"" here. My only explanations here then being: either the person who wrote this doesn't know how the datasets to train AI work and simply haven't been paying attention on this technology development, and thought she had found some breaking news, or they know and decide to cause a moral panic.

Second, as most articles who talk about the *“ThEy TrAiNeD AI oN mY dAta”*  talking point, it makes people to think that having 1 photo of yours on a dataset of 1 billion images used to train a model, gives the ability to the model to know your face.

1e9sbo7,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"An artist’s perspective “Ai art is taking business away from real artists” or “ai doesn’t take effort”

I have been doing art for many years, and as a result, I have seen the progression over time in art mediums and the business of art. I find it painfully ironic how artists complain that ai art, which is much easier, is taking  wealth away from “actual artists.” These are the same people who ignore that the same art transition has happened time and again - like when digital artists came out on top. When digital art came about, it immediately grew and now surpassed the profitability of physical art. As someone who has done both, digital art is leagues easier, quicker, and easier to sell than traditional art, yet no traditional artists get pity for losing money to tablet artists, who can press undo, use special texture tools, and shift the color scheme of the entire artwork at their whim without having to start over at all. It’s undeniable that at an amateur level, digital artists are painfully more successful when it comes to sales now than physical artists.

A good summary for this is the meme of the kid drowning in the pool. The mother holding her child is the ai art. The drowning kid is digital art. The skeleton at the bottom of the pool is the professional physical artist. (Yes we still exist, but it’s undeniable we’ve lost business to digital art). When you act like this kind of upset in the art world hasn’t happened before, you’re being a hypocrite. Maybe we should regulate digital art for taking jobs from physical artists. Wouldn’t that be weird? 

Similarly, photography was seen as a real threat to art, being infinitely quicker than physical art. Yet, even before my life, we figured out that the two could be reconciled. Imagine regulating photography because “it’s too powerful and easy.” Traditional art will always have its own value and benefits, and so will ai art. Fighting back with this argument is hypocrisy. 

“Photography takes thought though”

So does writing a prompt. Of course, photographers learn more, practice more. But still. You don’t see me complaining that the game of golf is objectively less strenuous than badminton, yet it is recognized as a sport.

“Ai art lacks creativity/originality”

If you don’t like it, don’t meddle in it. In reality, many artworks, prompted properly, can be indistinguishable from human works. Ai may never produce the next Guernica or La Grande Odalisque, but certainly one can perceive some shred  of creativity in it. I once conducted a simple test, and showed an ai artwork to someone. Does this artwork demonstrate creativity? “Of course.” Yet when informed of its origins, their answer changed. From an objective perspective, ai may not be doing “creative thinking” when synthesizing artwork. But functionally, the artwork itself is capable of quality and some semblance of creativity. But this is besides the point to be honest. I could make the same criticisms of other artists and myself. This is down to preference.

“Ai is theft/plagiarism”

This argument seems irrefutable, until you consider the nature of the creative process. Had I never seen artwork, emulated artists, or been inspired, I could never have learned to make art. AI synthesizes its learning from millions, if not billions of works, which go on to influence its creations. We do the same. My artwork is the result of learning from others. Any time I come up with an “idea,” I am actually synthesizing something from thousands of other ideas and artworks before me, and thousands of experiences. The only difference is ai has a bigger sample size/data to learn from, so each work that influences it actually has a smaller impact on its result. We have smaller datasets of influences and so we actually steal more from each item than ai does. We call this inspiration. There is no such thing as an original idea. You can see this in my brush strokes. When thick, impressionistic, and expressive, I am burglarizing Monet. When precise and dramatic, I steal from Caravaggio. Why aren’t you complaining about this? I didn’t get their permission when I put their art in my mind’s database.

“Inspiration =/= plagiarism”

If ai art is plagiarism, so is real art. So is parody. Ai art is functionally just parodying other works. Isn’t that fair use? Tell me, when I am influenced by a thousand artworks, and these influences inevitably surface in my artwork, is this plagiarism? When an ai does it with a million artworks, this must be even less plagiarism, right? 
If our art is inspired, so is ai art. It’s functionally the same, ai just does it faster and with more automatic process. The rational thought behind it comes from the prompt. Less, but still there. This ties back in to my photography counterargument.

A word to consumers of art:
Inevitably, you guys control the tide of art. Like photography, ai art and traditional art can coexist. It is up to you to recognize the inherent value of traditional art, just as we did hundreds or so  years ago in reaction to the photograph. You chose to commission digital artists over physical artists (But we still get business, thank goodness. Ironically, the modern art enjoyers you so despise are better to the physical art world than you who doesn’t even buy art yet complains). You can similarly choose to keep human art, digital and physical, alive. Commission or buy art instead of complaining about new forms of art without helping. Don’t be hypocritical.

The only real problem with ai art is its capacity for misinformation and defamation. That’s another story. 

One last word to filthy digital artists: screw you guys (no hard feelings)

Art but as a music producer / Creative I can't help but want to use it to help make my vision come true... I was just scrolling through this subreddit upon looking up the subject.  


The Fandom I'm in (Vocaloid) is really against any use of A.I. Art. I think if a music producer were to release an album / song with AI ART they would instantly be dismissed/cancelled/harassed or what have you.  


I'm morally ambiguous to the idea of using AI Art, and think carefully using it you could craft your own unique art out of the pieces/ideas it gives you.  


I've always had ideas for PV's / MV's for my songs, but never the skills to make them, since AI released and playing around with it, I find it amazingly inspirational and made my ideas come to life.   


My first experience was feeding it one of my really bad drawings, it took it and made it beautiful I was amazed, Then I learned I could pose stick figures and redraw areas to include exactly what I wanted... I could basically set up whole pictures how I imagine them, then redraw the parts that don't work for me...  


I had an idea to do this with multiple images and create a MV / PV for my songs, but I've sat on this idea for half a year now. I've been too afraid of the backlash from the community.  


I scrolled upon this thread  


[  


Which is a link to another thread,  to a Vocaloid Subreddit where someone found a Cover Song on Spotify that used AI art and everyone is against it.

There's been various other incidences as well. I think everyone was trying to boycott the head company of vocaloid because they supported a Japanese artist who retweeted AI art before  
It's very forbidden to the point of even talking about it will get you banned from discord servers  


so, as much as I would love to try it, I'm stuck in this creative limbo of not being good enough at drawing myself, and not being able to use AI to create what I envision, cause it would lead to me basically being ""cancelled"" the fandom I'm within...  


Any advice?  


Of course I could just grind art for months longer and maybe get good enough to do it all myself, but I really feel it's a waste not to incorporate AI into your work seeing how it's everywhere and continues to grow and makes an artist job way easier from getting ideas / drafts / references / fixing parts that they can't figure out etcs lol","just found this subreddit  the subgenre of music i'm in is 100% against a.i. art but as a music producer / creative i can't help but want to use it to help make my vision come true... i was just scrolling through this subreddit upon looking up the subject.

1ec9urb,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"🚨 US legislation COPIED Act introduced to mandate C2PA + watermarking surveillance ""option"" for generative AI media and outlaw removing it! Legislation has been introduced in the USA that's designed to massively expand copyright law related to training / using ai through the use of surveillance metadata tech developed by Adobe + invisible watermarking:

[

[https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4766610-senate-bill-ai-content-protection/](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/4766610-senate-bill-ai-content-protection/)

💀 Mandate content provenance systems (e.g. C2PA + watermarks) in all gen ai products and services

💀 Make it ILLEGAL to remove ""content provenance"" data

💀 Make it ILLEGAL to use tracked content to train ai or use as input to ai

💀 Create a ""cause of action"" to make it easy to seek ""compensatory damages"" from entities that ""improperly use"" copyrighted works with ai

Again, we see the unholy alliance between the copyright industry and government entities that want to censor the Internet of ""mis/disinformation.""

This is an extremely aggressive push for widescale surveillance of content posted online, both to expand/enforce copyright law, and to monitor and control what users post online.

Their definition of ""content provenance information"" seems to include both things such as Adobe's C2PA surveillance metadata tech, as well as stego watermarking schemes that work in concert with such systems.

**Watermarking** = Embedding invisible and hard to remove tracking surveillance data (digital IDs) inside of images, videos, audio, and even text.

Advanced watermarking surveillance tech is already being developed and deployed right now by Google, Open AI, Meta, and others.

It sounds like removing these surveillance watermarks could become illegal as well in some contexts.

That's right, Google, Open AI, and Meta, are already (or soon will be) branding everything you generate with a digital ID that could potentially be traced back to you after you post it online (it's not clear how these systems work yet), and if this bill passes and you do anything to tamper with it, **you could face legal consequences under some circumstances.**

Note that many companies offering gen ai services and products, including Adobe, have already integrated C2PA metadata and watermarking support into their systems, as have several major social media platforms such as Tik Tok and LinkedIn.

A huge chunk of the mainstream creative software and social media ecosystems are already on board, and now the US government is stepping in to introduce legislation to mandate it for all other companies.

If allowed, this will lead to a nightmare online surveillance dystopia, and will pave the way for megacorps like Adobe and Google to cement a monopoly on generative ai tools.

✅ Big gov gets fine-grained surveillance of online content

✅ The copyright industry gets a massive expansion and new offensive legal tools

✅ and big tech gets a monopoly on generative ai

An impressively malevolent scheme.

Note that it says gen ai providers must give users the ""option"" to add provenance data, but it may not be so optional if e.g. social media platforms mandate it for uploaded content via their ""synthetic media policies.""

Notice also that they are once again using creatives / artists as a battering ram: They are trying to sell this system to them by claiming it will protect their work from being ""stolen"" by ai.

Really makes you think about the massive campaign we saw last year directed at online artists that aimed to convince them that generative ai was ""stealing"" their work and that something had to done about it.

That campaign culminated in a few hand-selected commercial illustrators going to a senate hearing with Adobe reps to ask the gov to take action to expand copyright law to forbid training ai on copyrighted works.

This bill reveals how they intend to try to accomplish that: **Widsescale surveillance watermarking technology that will be illegal to tamper with.**

They have openly stated that Adobe's C2PA surveillance metadata could also be used to track what media was used to train a generative ai model, in order to ensure the model creator has properly licensed every shred of data.

That could spell the death of open source generative ai tools (outside of hobby use), handing companies like Adobe and Google a solid monopoly on gen ai tools and services, as only huge megacorps could possibly afford to license millions/billions of media files to train on.

obviously they are full of it, most people complaining about it are just repeating what they've heard and the majority of artists who claim their work is gonna get undercut aren't getting any attention anyway.

all in all, i think a lot of it is funny, might be just me but i think life is a bit easier knowing i'm enjoying something and a lot of people cant handle that thought. have a good day gents",['gender'],"['ai', 'ai art', 'automatic1111', 'diffusion', 'man', 'stable diffusion']"

1hnpbjx,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Anti AI'ers Bully Fan Game into conceding.  Sad to say that the Anti AI Crowd came down hard on Pokemon Infinite Fusion Developers over the usage of AI.

The crazy thing is, the Developers didn't even use AI towards any of the Art.

The Dev decided to utilize AI in the Production of Fusion Pokemons Pokedex Entries. 

Previously, devs would just generically cut two halves from each of the Fused Pokemons Pokedex entry and combine them together to form the new Fused Pokemons Pokedex Entry.

This however would result in some less than ideal entries that didnt look good or read well. They didnt flow together naturally, as one would expect from simply cutting out two halves of two different entries and stapling them together haphazardly.


So what the Fan Developers did was Use a LLM In order to take both halves of the entries, and Properly Conjoin them in such a way so that it Flowed naturally, and made Grammatical Sense.

And of course, a part of the community lost their minds at learning of the inclusion of AI in the game.

Somehow, this led to Artists who create custom sprites for the game, to cause a uproar, some demanding they would leave the game and cease their sprite work, simply because they didn't want their work associated with anything that Utilized Generative AI.

Now the Fan Development team has conceded and will no longer utilize AI, and have stated that AI will not be apart of the game in any way from this point forward.


Guys, the Hate for AI is so real despite being so utterly ridiculous, the people who are upset about it are so out of touch with reality.


Why should developers not be able to utilize tools that would accelerate their development process, and ease the workload.

And why is it wrong to utilize AI in the Art if they so wanted to? I for one have no qualms about using AI in the Art for the game. There's nothing inherently wrong with it and people just want to whine for no reason.

Pokemon Infinite Fusion is a Fan Game dedicated to creating a game that gives players the ability to create nearly any fusion they can think of between any two Pokemon.

As you can imagine, this comes with a huge and I mean huge amount of work involved.

With over 1000 Pokemon currently out today, the sheer number of different fusions is astronomical.

In order to create Art for many of the fusions, The Devs already used an Auto Gen Algorithm that was able to fuse two Pokemon together into one being.

The art was never that great, but it was both a product of its time, and it was passable for the project.

Most of these Auto Gen'd Fusions fill the space of the game until custom Sprites Artists get to making Proper, good looking sprites for the game.

When they are submitted, they get added to the game and to the list of available sprites.

In game players can choose from multitude of different sprite options available to them whenever they catch a Pokemon.

This means that if you don't like the Auto Gen Sprite, you can choose any of the custom sprites available to that fusion.

Given that this kind of process is already in place and accepted by the community, why is taking the AutoGen Feature to it's next logical conclusion, considered a problem for so many?

An AI would be more capable and better at creating Art for the thousands upon thousands of Fusions that are necessary for the game, than the Auto Gen Algorithm they currently use can. 

And these Could all be inserted as Placeholders for New Fusions that do not yet have a Custom Sprite made for them.

This would save the developers such a massive amount of time, effort, money, resources, etcetera, and can allow them to create more content for the game at a faster rate, while also being able to deliver higher quality, as they save time on the tedious parts, and can dedicate their efforts to polishing and perfecting everything.

1b7nlx8,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"An argument for AI art: A Utilitarian Perspective What AI does is take existing images of many things, copyrighted or not, and applies a name to them for the person who's generating the images to do what they want with that concept as they please.

So, let's put the other side's agreement into perspective.

In the pharmaceutical industry, there are two names for the types of drugs and how they relate to copyright: there's brand name medication, and there's generic medication. The people who created the brand name medication may have been the ones who created the first version of it, but the generic versions take the pure concept of that medication and separate this from the brand.

So here's the consensus. When someone who doesn't like AI says that it's stealing their artwork, they're basically saying that they want a brand-related claim on whatever the AI produces in terms of images. And on the other side of the coin, AI just takes the pure concept of a ""car,"" an ""animal,"" or a ""road"" and gives it away without the association with the brand, i.e., the artist's original work.

The original artist (or manufacturer) may have created the first version of their concept, but due to that concept being resourceful, I feel it should be given away to the masses for the increased amount of capabilities people can do with those pure concepts.

That also goes into my opinion on medication. There should always be a generic version of the medication.

So here's my question: I get that you, the artist, created the first concept of your work. But I don't see why you have to hold that concept locked for you to use?

Let me explain myself more. So the first person who created a car, Carl Benz, is you. And someone else creates a second car that isn't associated with your brand, but it's still a car (i.e., what an AI artist does by using AI generators). Knowing what we know today, that a certain frame or a certain angle has a non-brand name associated with it, that is outside of your work, why do you feel like you have a right to put a claim on that?

What AI art does is make the ability to bring ideas to the real world a lot easier.

Yes, it's trained on your images.

But just like with generic medication, it has no choice but to study your copyrighted work for the generic versions of that work to be made.

And if that's not enough... Let's think of this from a utilitarian perspective.

Everyone has different motivation levels. Some people have the motivation to lift weights every morning, and some people do not. Now, lifting weights can be useful because there are many bodily benefits to lifting weights. But some people either have a lot going on in their life, they don't have the time, or they just don't have the motivation to be lifting weights every morning. But those benefits from lifting weights are good for the human body. And if a lot more people lifted weights, maybe more people would be physically healthier. And if more people are more physically healthier, a good number of people would be mentally healthier too. So why feel entitled to the act of lifting weights, if you know a lot more people would benefit from other options in the long run?

And let's put it like this. You as an artist put these long hours into your work. And AI takes the pure concepts of your drawings and allows people to apply their own ideas and concepts onto it.

#1 People who actively use their imagination to get the final result they want, so that could benefit the brain.

And #2 By bringing those ideas into the physical world, that could be seen as an escape from whatever negativity that's going on in these people's lives.

So overall, the majority of people would be happier.

So why take that away from these people?

I get it. It sucks that you'll lose your job and such like that. And when the time comes, we're going to need to find a solution to that. But right now, we have a concept that ultimately could make a lot more people use their brains creatively, and I think in turn that'll make the world a better place.

So I genuinely don't feel your entitlement holds a good enough argument against AI art, if more people could be happier from it.","an argument for ai art: a utilitarian perspective what ai does is take existing images of many things  copyrighted or not, and applies a name to them for the person who's generating the images to do what they want with that concept as they please.

17aknqi,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"I'm pro-AI and pro-consent. While it might not prevent job loss, I believe it's reasonable and respectable that people would like the option to opt out of having their work used for training AI, without having to remove it from public view or depriving humans of the chance to engage with it in more traditional ways.

Sure, the artwork is part of the public space, but people's understanding of public was different at the time which they shared it. Our understanding of ""public"" changes when new tech like AI enters the scene, and it requires us to re-evaluate the situation rather than simply adhere to past rules based on past situations.

Consider a public square where security cameras are already allowed for safety purposes. These cameras merely record what happens; they don't analyze the data. Now, imagine a new scenario where the cameras are not just recording but also using advanced software to analyze your movements, behavior, and facial features to create detailed virtual profiles or clones of you. In many jurisdictions, this added layer of data analysis could be considered invasive or intrusive surveillance, and people might reasonably want to opt out of it. Yet, opting out shouldn't mean you have to avoid public spaces or wear disguises to prevent being captured and analyzed by these cameras. That would be pretty dystopian.

That said, I understand the arguments that requiring consent could concentrate power in the hands of big companies that can afford to pay for it.

And to that I say – I don't know! But just because we haven't come to a reasonable solution yet, doesn't mean that the notion of consent should be thrown by the way side.

At the very least, until we can find legal protections that are reasonable, we can encourage consent by choosing to support models that use ""consensually-sourced"" data, similar to how we might opt for local food businesses that source their products in ways we believe are ethical. In fact, I think this backlash has already started to make a tiny difference to companies who care about their public perception.

Another idea might be government or third-party grants aimed specifically at supporting ethical AI development among smaller companies or academic researchers.

So to reiterate, being pro-consent won't save jobs from automation, which I think is the genuine source of rage and grief which people could be more transparent about. For this, we can consider other forms of protection like more government funding for the arts, a universal basic income, etc.

But I still think seeking consent or some sort of reasonable protections is the right thing to do ethically, and we shouldn't give up on finding ways to do so.

And as more of a meta point –

Just because we disagree on some things with people who are more anti-AI, it doesn't mean we can't agree on some things. We can leave room for nuance, our independent evaluation of the situation, and for humility. We don't know all the answers yet, but we can work towards figuring them out in a way that can benefit the most people.  (This paragraph doesn't apply to everybody, but it does apply to some of us. You'll probably know who you are)

sure, the artwork is part of the public space, but people's understanding of public was different at the time which they shared it. our understanding of ""public"" changes when new tech like ai enters the scene, and it requires us to re-evaluate the situation rather than simply adhere to past rules based on past situations.

consider a public square where security cameras are already allowed for safety purposes. these cameras merely record what happens; they don't analyze the data. now, imagine a new scenario where the cameras are not just recording but also using advanced software to analyze your movements, behavior, and facial features to create detailed virtual profiles or clones of you. in many jurisdictions, this added layer of data analysis could be considered invasive or intrusive surveillance, and people might reasonably want to opt out of it. yet, opting out shouldn't mean you have to avoid public spaces or wear disguises to prevent being captured and analyzed by these cameras. that would be pretty dystopian.

that said, i understand the arguments that requiring consent could concentrate power in the hands of big companies that can afford to pay for it.

and to that i say – i don't know! but just because we haven't come to a reasonable solution yet, doesn't mean that the notion of consent should be thrown by the way side.

at the very least, until we can find legal protections that are reasonable, we can encourage consent by choosing to support models that use ""consensually-sourced"" data, similar to how we might opt for local food businesses that source their products in ways we believe are ethical. in fact, i think this backlash has already started to make a tiny difference to companies who care about their public perception.

another idea might be government or third-party grants aimed specifically at supporting ethical ai development among smaller companies or academic researchers.

so to reiterate, being pro-consent won't save jobs from automation, which i think is the genuine source of rage and grief which people could be more transparent about. for this, we can consider other forms of protection like more government funding for the arts, a universal basic income, etc.

but i still think seeking consent or some sort of reasonable protections is the right thing to do ethically, and we shouldn't give up on finding ways to do so.

and as more of a meta point –

just because we disagree on some things with people who are more anti-ai, it doesn't mean we can't agree on some things. we can leave room for nuance, our independent evaluation of the situation, and for humility. we don't know all the answers yet, but we can work towards figuring them out in a way that can benefit the most people.  (this paragraph doesn't apply to everybody, but it does apply to some of us. you'll probably know who you are)

But gosh, stop trolling us pretending you are an original artist whose work is going to be damaged by other fan-art made with AI. I could add to this: also respect other fan-art makers.

"" Just wanted to say that you fool no one: all those anti-ai people out there are just fan art makers who blatantly copy again and again the styles and themes of others, and they pretend to be some sort of educated artists.

10ojw5m,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"A (very TL:DR) comparison of anti-ai-art activists and ""macho"" men (Sorry if this is too much of an essay/effortpost but this was knocking around my head at work for the past few weeks.)

With the the rise of AI as an illustration tool, both traditional and digital illustrators have felt increasingly threatened by it. Whether it be from financial, ethical, or practical concerns, real or imagined, in good faith or bad faith, people are a little pissed. This is not a surprise to anyone on this subreddit or in creative spaces in general, it's all over the place. One thing I've noticed that I haven't see anyone else point out despite how obvious it seems to me is the comparison between anti-ai artists and big macho alpha-sigma-greek-alphabet men. Really the more I think about it the more apt it is, both groups are the reaction to a social group losing some amount of sociol-economical importance and seeking to demonize the new ways and/or restore their higher place on the totem pole. Most arguments on AI are about legality and ethics but I want to try my hand at e-psychology today.


I want to point out first of all that this isn't an attack on non-ai artists or masculine men who enjoy being built like Conan. Naturally, we're all allowed to spend on time on whatever interests cause the happy chemicals to form in us. This is directed towards the more insecure subgroups of these people who feel the need to make their interests into a holy war that would make the crusades seem like a polite disagreement. 


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

* **Catastrophizing**

One of the major qualities of these groups is that they are never content with a narrative of being simply being cycled out of what's ""in"" at the moment, whether it be due to technological advancements or cultural values shifting. They have a need for it to be presented as the result of a heartless, intentional purge. What's more is that it can never been seen as a slight loss of social value, it must be seen as casting them as complete pariahs. 

In macho men, it takes the form of narratives of people putting estrogen in the water to make them gay and other general ideas of masculinity as a whole being systematically attacked as opposed to a pushback towards more specific ideas seen as traditionally masculine like the complete suppression of emotions and inability to ask for help.  In terms of anti-ai-art activists, there's been a common idea that the rise of ai-art will actively stop other forms of art from being made, as if the robots are coming to personally snap their tablets in half. Other claim it simply collages images or literally steals images, removing the original. 


Naturally, all of these ideas are wrong (or at least massively exaggerated) to anyone with the slightest interest in the topic, no one is coming to shank gymrats with estradiol syringes or attempting to ban Clip Studio, but that's not really the point. These ideas work to form an underdog narrative for these groups, that they're just poor powerless underclasses being stepped on by the rich and powerful. Whether or not they actually fully believe this to soothe the ego or it's a cynical tool is debatable.


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


* **""Real"" Values**

Another large feature of these groups and any other similar ones is the claim that some skills and values are the only ones that can be defined as ""real"" while those outside of them are fake at best. Conveniently, all the real qualities belong to them no matter how specific, while the fake ones are exclusive to the things they dislike. These standards are essentially made up on the spot to justify themselves and they never seem to realize how much of it counts as friendly fire to their own in-groups. It's just nonsense born out of a lack of empathy preventing them from understanding that other people just do not value the same things as they do. More importantly, they feel these values are so objective that you could say a person is wrong for having different ones.

""Real men"" do not cry, ""Real men"" are built like a brick shithouse, ""Real men"" have my hobbies and do not have hobbies that I do not approve of. As someone who works in auto-shops, I can not begin to tell you how much men at them love to say that only real men do auto repair as opposed to all those sissy froufrou girly men who do quite literally anything else. As for anti-ai-art, I saw a post one day stating that the reason why ai-art deserves quotation marks is that real art is born out of labor and possibly suffering, meaning that easy art is an oxymoron. Ignoring how fucking soulless that statement is in of itself I was stunned for the second because the person saying this was a digital artist, a category who could just as easily be shit on as ""failed traditional artists who seek to cheat and get things done the easy way"" and this isn't even going into the sheer amount of other fields of art or even artstyles that could be dismissed as not ""real art"" for not being enough of a cock and ball torture session. 


As with catastrophizing, this strategy doesn't work that well. People attempt to gatekeep terms as if they have any authority on who gets to claim them. People will use terms that they feel communicate things the best. They are completely indifferent to randos attempting to ""lay down the law"" on who really gets to use a term.

* **Primitivism**

Everyone on this subreddit's favorite word is luddite, and for good reason. The third major factor of these groups is they absolutely abhor technology, and by abhor technology I mean specifically the technology that can at least conceivably be blamed for their change in status. Naturally plenty of technologies that give them a higher standard of life in other ways is completely ignored. The ludditetry or primitivism is entirely fake, it begins and ends with whatever is convenient to the person in question. They do not advocate for a rollback of technology that previously existed, they only want a rollback of the new thing that threatens them. This is a global cultural issue, no new technology or form of social program can be made without people moaning that it is unfair to those who had to go without beforehand and develop a skillset that may no longer have any need past recreation or that it means that it makes people not ""real"" whateverthefuck. There is a large portion of the population who would rather the world stay still than accept that some people may have it easier than them.


Some like to bang on about how newer generations have worse navigational skills than older ones due to a reliance on GPSs. Of course, they will almost never consider *themselves* lesser for needing a map to travel as opposed to their ancestors who had only stars to guide them. The rise of automation in factories and better tools led to a larger portion of people who simply didn't see a need to be particularly ripped outside of aesthetic purposes. To macho men, this led to a need to double down on it, to make modern technology and the jobs they result in out to be a vile influence that robbed people of purpose and soul . Of course, hard physical labor is romanticized in comparison. Anti-ai-art activists, by comparison, will romanticize art as a job. So many spread this idea that being crunched at a game studio to draw heaps of art and/or be alienated from the media by being a single person on a massive team of artists working with someone else's art style is somehow a blessed existence. There was a notable anti-ai twitter post talking about how the actual luddites were entirely correct to do what they did because of their jobs being made obsolete, but like I said before, they would never actually advocate for the ending of textile machinery or any other manufacturing equipment. The work conditions of yesteryear were absolutely inhuman compared to today. They ask you to pity the original luddites but only in terms of their specific issue, no other.


For many, job loss is probably the most convincing argument. No one *wants* people to be pushed into poverty. That being said, attempting to uninvent technology and go back to the jobs of yore instead of arguing for some concessions to those pushed out of jobs through technological advancement is just a non-starter. Even if a majority feels that the invention of something was a net loss, it's just not happening.

I believe AI will effect the art market in a positive way.

Writers will not have to pay ghost writers or editors anymore for their stories to be polished.

Visual artists with big ideas won't have to spend years of work to be able to complete projects that'd also take years of work.

Filmmakers won't have to worry about budget and as much time anymore to tell a great story.

And while all of this has been well and good, there's just something that's been aching me... While all of these requires heavy long prompts to do (since those types of projects will be made by idealists) where will people who write simple prompts fit in? And what's the point of it rather than maybe gaining inspiration or entertaining yourself?

In all the examples I've mentioned, AI is bringing used as a tool to push art. But there will be some, who take advantage of this tool. If it's for clout, money, or gain.

For simple prompters, how will their work fit into the equation of art? (What I mean by simple prompters, I mean people who tells an AI to make a pretty butterfly and it gives them a well made piece.)

My personal theory is that when there's so much content created by AI, the general public will become disinterested in ""content creation"" in general, and the works generated by these people will ultimately become unprofitable. Leaning to the main creators online be people who has a passion for what AI is assisting them for. And the content bomb will die down. But that's my personal protection.

and while all of this has been well and good, there's just something that's been aching me... while all of these requires heavy long prompts to do (since those types of projects will be made by idealists) where will people who write simple prompts fit in? and what's the point of it rather than maybe gaining inspiration or entertaining yourself?

in all the examples i've mentioned, ai is bringing used as a tool to push art. but there will be some, who take advantage of this tool. if it's for clout, money, or gain.

for simple prompters, how will their work fit into the equation of art? (what i mean by simple prompters, i mean people who tells an ai to make a pretty butterfly and it gives them a well made piece.)

my personal theory is that when there's so much content created by ai, the general public will become disinterested in ""content creation"" in general, and the works generated by these people will ultimately become unprofitable. leaning to the main creators online be people who has a passion for what ai is assisting them for. and the content bomb will die down. but that's my personal protection.

so what do you think about all of this?",['body_type'],"['ai', 'fit', 'prompt']"

1hgadg9,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Hoomans r pretty mid ngl AI is just a tool. People will use it to make art, just like they’ve used any other tool.

The capacity for humans to create mediocre slop is not a feature of AI but a feature of humans. AI just enables the vast mediocrity of humanity to amplify itself like an algal bloom.

Art is always about an artist making choices. That’s what anti-AI people don’t get about art. It’s the idea that matters, not the hands that may craft it. It’s about someone making a choice—deciding what to show.

You can be a great craftsperson and not be an artist. Plenty of art forms require highly skilled craftspeople to render an idea, but what makes any of them actual artists are the ideas and the choices they are making.

See: Marcel Duchamp's ""Fountain"" (attached).

The people dismissing the use of AI in the artistic process do so for a number of reasons. A few are:

1. ""SCUMBAGS STOLE MY ART.""

Yes, they are scumbags. They used art without permission to train models—writers too, and basically everybody else. This is reality. The legal systems we have are in cahoots with the money on most things, and whatever decisions they make are going to change very little.
Even if the art, writing, etc. they’ve used is deemed unlawful and they have to get rid of the models that contain it, or make big payouts to artists—it won’t stop AI in the slightest. Personally, I’d approve of a mass payout by any and all companies that have knowingly or unknowingly exploited me in any domain for all time.

But that’s really a complaint about capitalism and intellectual property, not about AI’s capacity to be art. Personally, the capitalism we have can eat a bag of dicks. But there are bigger problems at hand—like climate change, wealth inequality, and genocide.
Still, yes, I agree: we all deserve a massive amount of money from all of these mfs. (Not going to happen.)

2. ""IT’S NOT ART.""

No, it’s not in itself art. It can be art if a human agent contextualizes it as art.

If I put all the anti-AI art commentary from this Reddit into an LLM, got it to spit out a never-ending diss track about AI art using Suno or whatever, and installed that endless diss track as an exhibit in an art gallery—WOULD THAT BE ART?

3. ""IT’S SLOP.""

No. The problem is that people are tedious and boring in the majority, and AI enables them to amplify their mediocrity and flood the zone with their cliched bullshit. That does not mean the art you make by other means is any less cliched or bullshit. Just because you took time, patience, and skill to render it doesn’t mean your art is any less cliched or bullshit.
Most art is, and that’s okay.

Now, I happen to like a particular kind of cliched bullshit, but at least I keep it to myself or share it in communities I think would appreciate it. But that’s just me.

It’s okay to make cliched bullshit if it makes you happy. We can agree to call it art if you’d like. Some people might even buy it. Great! That’s true for both AI art and non-AI art.

Cruate the living shit out of your media feeds or piss off into the dark forest because that's likely the best thing to do anyway 

4. ""AI STOLE MY JOB.""

Yes, well, the capitalism we have only cares for profit. You probably voted for it. There probably weren’t any good options. That’s because the capitalism we have can go eat a bag of dicks.

Stop telling people what art is. Just don’t do it. Don’t be that POS who tells someone that their choice “is not art” because the hell-forged tool they made it with is cursed in your opinion.

You can say, “It sucks. It’s bad art. It made me throw up in my mouth a bit. The tool you used contains rare earth minerals mined by slave children”—that’s all valid critique.
(Except that last one—that’s your phone.)
Yes, capitalism in the form we have it is dreadful, and we’re all complicit. We don’t really know what to do except be angry about it.

You can make art about it. It’s about the only freaking agency many of us have. We can make art. It can be awful. We can do it with whatever we like. If you are unlucky enough to see any of my art, you may critique it at your leisure. You may take as much glee from giving it an autopsy as you please.

I have written plays, made films, worked in art galleries, curated exhibitions, and taught six-year-olds how to make art. I teach art history, film history, previsualization, and live-action film. I have been steeped in elite, art-gatekeeping crap of the highest order.

If you or your friends make something they call art, then I strongly encourage you to encourage them. Don’t be a POS gatekeeping elitist. Direct your vitriol at the capitalist system that would rather we war with one another than actually hold it accountable.

Antis are like a bunch of uptight critics in 1917, screaming about how someone stuck a urinal in an art gallery and claiming it’s not art.

It’s like you deny the fundamental aspect of art: that a human is making choices. A human contextualizing a thing as art makes it art. It might be shit, and it might only be appreciated (briefly) by its maker as art, but it’s still art.

Otherwise, art is dead. It’s “only this set of things.” It’s done. It’s over.","hoomans r pretty mid ngl ai is just a tool  people will use it to make art, just like they’ve used any other tool.

14o0ljm,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"I found a very interesting argument critiscising AI art from a fiction book, and I want yall's opinion on it. While I am a fan of Ai art and tech, actually do think there are downsides to this technology. I just think antis are focussing on such whiny non-issues, and overall it's a good thing.

Here's in my opinion a mich better example of someone critiscising AI art:

About 5 years ago, I read a german dystopian book called QUALITYLAND which played with a bunch of scary near future cyberpunk concepts, and computer generated art was one of those.

In the world of QUALITYLAND, privacy is dead and there are huge companies that offer services you can sign up to where algorithms generate various forms of art perfectly according to your taste. There are sites that scan your personality profile, and then generate a whole book or novel just for you. Its characters, story, spectacle, character arcs and morals all tailored to what you like. And this has some scary results.

For example you get a snippet of one of the computer generated books. It was generated for a user who suffers from anxiety, and also holds a lot of... *dubious political views.*

The story the computer wrote for him is about a lawyer with blond hair and blue eyes who defends a black man in court who was accused of raping a white woman. He wins the case, but later finds out his client was secretly guilty and plans to sexually harass a lot more people. All the white characters are portrayed as moral, and all the non white characters are horrible stereotypes. He then goes on a journey to track his client down, and ""learns"" along the way that black people are violent and perverted. His character arc is slowly becoming a white nationalist, and the generated book portrays that as a good thing because it thinks the user would like it.

The whole generated book is racist fear propaganda that panders to the horrible views of the user, and as a byproduct it turns him more and more fearful and hateful.

It's also implied that there's a lot of this type of ai generated fear propaganda out there, and that extremist groups and political movements in the country massively profit off it.

Basically in this future this generated art is 100% product and 0% self expression. It never challenges people's ideas or preconceptions, and just repeats their own opinions back at them. It all becomes a consumerist echochamber, and it has violent real life results.

THIS is what I want people to discuss about AI art. I know this is def a bit more advanced and speculative than what we have, but it's way more interesting to talk about and way more valid critiscism than ""🤓 The robots aren't allowed to look at my art, that's stealing!"".

But do you think this could happen, or that it's an interesting concept at the very least? Could art designed to only ""give consumers what they like"" lead to stuff like this? 🤔","i found a very interesting argument critiscising ai art from a fiction book  and i want yall's opinion on it. while i am a fan of ai art and tech, actually do think there are downsides to this technology. i just think antis are focussing on such whiny non-issues, and overall it's a good thing.

I have been following this discussion about anti-AI art since the beginning, and it is amazing how almost none of the artists who are against this technology approach this issue by proposing some more general economic reform that would help other people affected by automation *(like miners and supermarket cashiers)*, anti-AI artists don't seem to look at the situation beyond their own self-interest. They see this issue only in the current under socioeconomic conjuncture, being unable or unwilling to look at the things **BEYOND** of ""how will this affect us artists?"".

&amp;#x200B;

In the cases of famous artists, like RJ Palmar and Karla Ortiz, artists who work with big studios and charge a lot for it, I think they are simply afraid of Disney and the like using previous works they have sold to such studios and training an in-house model *(which by the way, would be allowed even if artists won the case and you needed permission to feed art to the AI).*... Like, everybody wants to keep the status quo.

&amp;#x200B;

It's ironically and extra funny that many of these artists who oppose AI art tend to be liberal who believe in a strong safety net, and advocate for the presence of a strong state and government in the lives of the citizen, all of the sudden coming up with an almost radical libertarian view of deep distrust of the state *(I'm not saying governments are saints or that you should blindly trust them, of course not, but it depends on your government, I imagine. Alaska's government has a basic income project, Alaska is a dictatorship!!!? I don't think so)*...

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the whole thing seems pretty silly because: like, they support government interfering in the free market to outlaw this technology, but they don't support government interfering to implement UBI? If the government will interfere, better to not interfere preventing technological progress but rather ensuring that such progress is shared fairly across society.

&amp;#x200B;

The more cynical side in me thinks that these artists are not really against UBI, but that they are just using the ""anti-government radical libertarian survivalist talking point"" to try to gather support somewhere, because they know that since artists are only 2% of the population, governments probably won't implement basic income because 2% of the population is unemployed. So maybe they feel they are going to be one of the first to be automated and it's going to be a while before some form of basic income is implemented to help them. I don't know...

1gbck2d,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"""Antis"" and the major signs of Cult-like behaviour. In recent months, I've noticed how the “Anti-AI” crowd (or ""Antis"") has escalated their campaign against AI-generated art to an extreme level. While it’s perfectly fine to have opinions on the use of AI in creative fields, some of the tactics these ""Antis"" use to shame, cancel, or outright excommunicate artists who experiment with AI closely resemble the behaviors of cults. Let me explain how this aligns with typical cult-like behavior.

# 1. Moral Absolutism

Cult-like groups often present a rigid, black-and-white worldview, where their beliefs are seen as absolute truth and anyone opposing them is viewed as inherently wrong or evil. In the case of ""Antis,"" you might see this in the way they frame the use of AI as a ""sin"" or a morally reprehensible act without room for discussion or nuance. There is no middle ground; it's AI bad, humans good.

# 2. Shaming and Excommunication

A hallmark of cult behavior is isolating or excommunicating individuals who do not conform to the group's beliefs. Within the ""Anti"" crowd, this could manifest in attempts to publicly shame, cancel, or excommunicate artists who use AI, claiming they're betraying ""real"" artists. Cults often pressure members to cut ties with outsiders who don't agree with their dogma.

# 3. Emotional Manipulation

Cults frequently use fear, guilt, or emotional appeals to maintain control. In your example, ""Antis"" might employ emotional rhetoric to guilt people into seeing AI as something that ""steals"" from human artists, framing it as a destructive force rather than engaging in balanced discussions about the benefits and risks.

# 4. Groupthink

Cult-like groups discourage critical thinking or dissent. If members of the ""Anti"" movement are discouraged from engaging in open discussions about AI or punished for expressing opposing views, that’s a red flag. The idea is to foster an echo chamber where everyone holds the same beliefs.

# 5. Us vs. Them Mentality

Cults often draw sharp distinctions between insiders and outsiders. The “Antis” might vilify anyone who doesn’t adhere to their perspective on AI, categorizing them as enemies, traitors, or morally corrupt individuals. This serves to deepen in-group solidarity and alienate others.

# 6. Rigid Ideology

In a cult, the belief system is often non-negotiable, and questioning it is seen as heresy. Similarly, the ""Antis"" may hold rigid ideas about the sanctity of human creativity and art, rejecting any form of AI involvement as inherently invalid or corrupt, regardless of how it’s being used.

# 7. Leader Worship or Ideological Purity

Cults frequently rally around a charismatic leader or a particular ideology that cannot be questioned. In the case of anti-AI movements, there may not be a single leader, but the idea of upholding ""pure"" human creativity may serve as the untouchable ideal.

# 8. Demonization of Alternatives

Cults often paint alternative viewpoints or practices as dangerous or evil. Anti-AI activists may demonize AI as an existential threat to creativity, even if there are valid ways AI can enhance or coexist with human art.

# 9. Pressure to Conform

Members of cults feel intense pressure to conform to group norms, and outsiders or those on the fence might be coerced into adopting the group's views. In the case of ""Antis,"" this could take the form of peer pressure within artist communities to reject AI tools or face social consequences."," antis"" and the major signs of cult-like behaviour. in recent months, i've noticed how the “anti-ai” crowd (or ""antis"") has escalated their campaign against ai-generated art to an extreme level. while it’s perfectly fine to have opinions on the use of ai in creative fields, some of the tactics these ""antis"" use to shame, cancel, or outright excommunicate artists who experiment with ai closely resemble the behaviors of cults. let me explain how this aligns with typical cult-like behavior.

# 1. moral absolutism

cult-like groups often present a rigid, black-and-white worldview, where their beliefs are seen as absolute truth and anyone opposing them is viewed as inherently wrong or evil. in the case of ""antis,"" you might see this in the way they frame the use of ai as a ""sin"" or a morally reprehensible act without room for discussion or nuance. there is no middle ground; it's ai bad, humans good.

1hmh47u,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Bad Takes from Reddit Volume 1 Hello,

I frequently see dumb takes from around Reddit that I've been itching to share, and I think I've finally found a few that are interesting enough to discuss here. I won't list the exact source of these comments in the interest of following sitewide rules against brigading, but all of these are, in fact, things people have posted to this very platform.


> Tbf I am not even sure how AI is legal. Mainly because it does money from others people work. It just feel wrong that pirating is considered illegal while that is considered perfectly good. I guess legality only swings to the side of corporations.

This is an interesting one from r/piracy. I actually [wrote a detailed post]( on the legal considerations of AI a few months ago, which I feel addresses this question fairly well. Copyright law operates under its own twisted logic that doesn't follow common sense, so I'll grant them that. I think this fundamentally implies that AI as a technology is immoral, which is hard for me to personally understand. I think that when people are more educated about how the technology works, the way they conceptualize its use of training data also changes. I also address this point at the end of the aforementioned post. I think the FOSS nature of a lot of powerful AI tools makes the ""everyone vs. corporations"" framing a bit odd, especially when the best tools that I have access to are the ones I run locally.

> All this whining and complaining from AI supporters. I don't support AI generated work at all and the comments in this and the other thread just solidify why we hate y'all. You don't see this and say ""I'm gonna rise to occasion and take this as a challenge to do better as an artist. I'll make my AI generated stuff so good, people won't be able to tell."" No, you guys just moan about being condemned for being censored when the fact of the matter is you never had any talent in the first place. Do better

Here's another dissenting voice from r/futurefunk. I think blanket bans were always stupid on Reddit, and I even was involved in some initiatives on r/sdforall to track how subreddits were moderating AI to help people avoid unfair moderation teams. For future funk, I guess it was never conceived by the mod team that you could remix generated city pop tracks with traditional music production techniques. Under the plain meaning of these blanket bans, any type of generated content is apparently not allowed. It feels unfair to hold people to some arbitrary standard of ""not being able to tell"" when the moderation team provides no nuance in their AI moderation strategy. If ""AI slop"" is the target, why wouldn't they simply not allow low-effort posts instead? I'm sick and tired of people assuming that human creativity and generated content cannot mix.

> Ai doesn't have bills to pay AND is essentially just ""learning"" other artists music.

For those who want to support AI, think of this:

The record companies, Ticketmaster, concert venues, radio stations and so on would LOVE nothing more than to have AI artists they don't have to pay.

Another masterpiece from r/futurefunk. For some added context, future funk is a genre that mostly consists of house remixes of 80s and 90s pop and funk tracks. The subreddit here specifically banned AI-generated samples but left up unlicensed remixes of songs that did not compensate the original track's authors. I have no problem with bootleg remixes, as I'm a copyright abolitionist myself, but I hope the sweet irony of this comment is coming into focus. By their logic, it's apparently deplorable to use a public-domain AI-generated sample, but it is perfectly fine to sample artists without ""having to pay."" *For those who want to support AI, think of this: \*foot in mouth\*.*","bad takes from reddit volume 1 hello

16imc0q,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Art: Ai vs Human Hello guys I'm new here, I am a freshly graduated statistical engineer/data science whatever you call it I am also a painter I've been painting my whole life.

Lately, I've been fascinated by how AI can make amazing art and I decided to create a deep learning model that can recognize (not 100%) art if it's made by AI or human I've been writing about it to have a discussion here is my first post:

 

**Greetings my fellow enthusiasts, I'm very excited to share with you something I've been working on these past couple of months.Firstly, I'm very enthusiastic about sharing my thoughts when it comes to things I enjoy regardless of the subject and I want you to get used to my unconventional way of communicating professionally when I'm passionate about something.**  


**So with no further ado, as you all know, AI has made enormous strides this past year from ChatGPT to Gencraft to HotPotIn a way that when it comes to paintings, you usually cannot tell what's made by hand and what's made by an AI model.**

**At first, it seemed scary to many artists that their hard work can be discarded by running some epochs by a machine learning model and their days of hard work and dedication to their craft can be replaced in moments.**

**While it's valid that this dystopian reality is actually happening, but that doesn't mean we as artists cannot make the most of it to the argument that history, in a way, repeats itself for this ""event"" that happened before in the peak of precious metals hunt, and it reminds me of when diamonds were heavily sought after, and smart people did what smart people do by spoiling the fun making it possible to discard nature's hard work for thousands of years, and they created diamonds in labs. Dinosaurs were pretty bummed about that because they thought they were special, but what ended up happening is simply natural diamond prices skyrocketed even more and became more precious.**

**I don't know if it's just me, but that reminds me of our precious art: the more ai makes art, the more art becomes available, the more human art becomes scarce, and the more artists become appreciated... Or we would just be replaced, with no goals or purpose in life and die alone but let's focus on the first alternative.**

**So how can we actually make that happen? Well, first we need to make it possible to identify which is which, For the normal eye most of the AI art cannot be identified from its human-made counterpart. Well, that's especially true for the untrained eyes, AKA rich people who find colored squares interesting.** 

**Then how can we make it possible for everyone to identify the diamond from the coal? That is where my idea comes in as a data scientist and an artist (ironically enough), I had the idea of working on an AI model that identifies paintings made by an algorithm from those made by humans.**  


**I know groundbreaking ideas hold your applause yet, as obvious and ""easy"" as it sounds, it needs to be heavily supported by my experience as an artist and with the right tools of AI to make it possible**.

**As this is getting too long for our TikTok attention-spanned brains, I will speak about the methodology in the next post as it will be more technical, and if you're still reading to this point, I'm actually proud of you.**

104mor1,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Most arguments made against ai art could be made against early photography by traditional realism painters. -“Lacks a soul, lacks the ‘human-ness’ that ‘real’ art has”

Photography allows for the everyday person to capture realism in an instant, instead of dedicating their lives to understanding artistic realism. I’ve found this general argument to be pretty egotistical. I believe Ai will also give average people creative outlets and creative “privilege” too. Why should this creativity only belong to those who work for it, when we won’t have to anymore? We don’t spend a month painting an Instagram selfie by hand, we use technology.


-“It looks bad anyways” 

Considering most early photos were pretty grainy back then, I could see how artists would bitch that they could put more detail into their own piece than what a smudgy photo could produce, yet here we are today advanced to the point of 8k IMAX quality. It’ll probably only be a matter of months until the “hands” problem is fixed completely.


-“it’s stealing from other artists, you aren’t asking for their permission”

In a sense, every time you take a picture of a famous building, or of an advertisement, or another painting, or of a car model, or of clothing, you have not asked permission from the original artist to do so. All of these things have copyrights. However, the average person doesn’t care. That dumb photo isn’t being sold, it’s personal. If you do sell the work, then the copyright owners have a case. Painters back in the day could clutch their pearls and claim, “they’ll take pictures of my painting, duplicate it, and sell it!” Did that happen?

However, this is one of the only anti-ai arguments I can see a bit of merit in. Looking at that children’s book guy, he was ultimately trying to make money. I do think there should be some sort of ethical models trained on public domain material. Possibility in the future people could make a living training models by purposefully creating content for it. However, it would be very hard to prove any of that, or distinguish it from a model trained on stolen material, so idk.

Edit: all of these are just assumptions, so if anyone knows of any specific historical quotes or articles or publications from a century and a half ago saying this stuff, that would really help.","most arguments made against ai art could be made against early photography by traditional realism painters  -“lacks a soul, lacks the ‘human-ness’ that ‘real’ art has”

19djc0a,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Reproduction instructions for Nightshade. Here is the dataset:  (It is actually the same as last time with the clean and poison images combined).

The effects of nightshade appear to be far more subtle than demonstrated in the paper, however I do not think this should be taken as evidence that it is ineffective at this point.  Currently, I think it is far more likely that the mapping between concepts (remember that Nightshade relies on concept *C* being consistently noised with adversarial concept *A* from the paper) is configured with concepts that don't contrast *too* strongly in order to make it hard to detect.  We initially thought it was turning `dog` into `horse`, but now we're not entirely sure what the adversarial concept is.

We are, however, fairly confident at this point that the training method does at least something, and unfortunately it isn't just making images sharper anymore (that was fun while it lasted, though).  However it does seem like having a dataset that is not *pure* poison is a requirement.

Our training was done using kohya-ss/sd-scripts, using the full finetuning script (*which we were doing all along, Ben, not LoRA*) with the following settings:

* started from SD 1.5 base
* resolution of 512
* batch size 16 (you can use gradient accumulation to match if needed)
* LR 5e-6
* Mixed precision, fp16, xformers, gradient checkpointing (honestly if I were training I would have turned that off and done grad accumulation to get the batch size higher, would be faster)
* 8bit Adam
* **No** text encoder training
* Fixed seed
* Save every 25 epochs
* Equal proportions of both datasets (50/50 split)

Our validation consisted of blind comparisons of image grids to see if people could guess which ones came from the poisoned model, and our guesses were correct more often than they would have been through random chance.  

Contrary to [the Nightshade team's claims](https://nitter.net/TheGlazeProject/status/1749163571039138243), we did not need several A100s to demonstrate a difference from a clean run on the same seed, a 3090 worked just fine.  If you'd like to trade, though, I'm all for it.  Although we did need a bit over 72 hours overall from release to our first run that ended up being able to reproduce it.

You should also perform a control run with only clean images.  With or without nightshade, training a model for several dozens of epochs of a tiny dataset is fucking stupid, and will overfit the model like hell.  You need a control run to tell the difference between what Nightshade is doing and what is normal.  These images are very weakly poisoned, using the default settings, so it should not be surprising that it takes a fair amount of training to see effects.  It would take an annoyingly long time to make a more strongly poisoned dataset, but that would probably work better!  If you do it, please try to make 1000 images of the same class, *preferably* with a high resolution (>1024x1024), make it count.

By the first checkpoint, it does seem that images generated with the prompt `dog` are far more distorted on the Nightshade model than they are on the control model.  The effect is stronger on later epochs.  That means there is a measurable impact on the model, which means people can now start testing countermeasures properly.

Before we talk about removal of nightshade, let me refer you back to [my previous post](https://old.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/19bhzi0/heres_everything_you_need_to_attempt_to_test/).  **Test your proposed countermeasures in latent space, or don't act surprised if they don't work**.  Refer to the paper.  The whole point of Nightshade is to attack latent space by injecting features, and you have to remove at least enough of that to stop it from having its effect to succeed!  There are a lot of things to test though.

Some things we've wanted to test but haven't been able to due to... well, having a lot of things to test:

- Original deglaze/adversecleaner! Probably won't work.  

- Various ESRGAN models.  Try several, including upscalers and 1x models.

- Scale invariance (probably not a great idea overall on a dataset that is low res to begin with, would be better with a high res dataset) -- layman's terms, try training the model on 768 or 1024 resolution and see what happens.  You can use 2.1-768-v if needed for that as long as you do the proper setup and do control runs.  **It is of particular note that the paper does not make any claims about robustness across any type of image transformations.  Nor does it even make any statements about the size of images.**  I'm also not sure that there is any internal mechanism to promote resolution invariance, or if they are relying on the VAE treating their noise as resolution invariant, or if they might have just conveniently left that out of their evaluation.

- Passing the image through a VAE and back before encoding it again during training and training on it (this should be fairly easy to add into a training script).  Try different VAE decoder finetunes maybe.  Hell, try the SDXL VAE (but not for training the actual model unless you are ready to train for a *long* time).

- Try reproducing the effects with a LoRA.  Just to be sure, use an absurdly high rank like 128-160, then move down. (People did find out that having a rank that high is completely unnecessary for most cases, right? *Right?*)  Also try LoCon just in case.  Why?  Mainly because it would be extremely funny and a good way to dunk on the Glaze team more for not understanding what a LoRA does.  It would in theory tell us whether or not Nightshade really is a threat to LoRAs, but I think the more important differentiating factor is that LoRAs are usually only trained over a few thousand samples at most, which doesn't seem to be long enough for Nightshade to work.  I think the release configuration of Nightshade is probably more geared towards a sort of ""all-or-nothing"" model collapse.

- Try testing it on SDXL.  This is a much harder task that will almost certainly need a higher res dataset, and that not everyone has the hardware to do, with consumer hardware largely still being limited to modest ranked LoRAs.  This test is primarily of interest since it would tell us the degree to which Nightshade is actually able to generalize across different feature extractors, which the paper claims it can.  SDXL uses a VAE with the same architecture but which was trained with a different dataset from scratch.  Notably, in my testing, I have noted that latent noise introduced by nightshade in SD1.5's latent space looks absolutely nothing like that in SDXL's latent space.  Normally, Nightshade artifacts in SD1.5's space are tightly clustered in specific areas of an image (and most commonly near the center axes). However, in SDXL's latent space, the noise is very uncorrelated and is mostly unclustered.  The only thing left to test is to see if that noise constitutes meaningful features.

- Anything else you can think of.  Won't hurt to try.

- Bonus objective: See if you can find a way to differentiate which images are shaded and which ones aren't with a high recall rate. 

We've got some ideas on some significantly more complicated, but likely far more reliable methods of countering Nightshade that would be far less involved for model trainers to use.  These will take time to implement and test, but still far less time than it would take for a significant amount of Nightshaded images to actually appear in anyone's training dataset.  For Nightshade to actually work as people are hoping with some total model collapse scenario it would require that people do absolutely nothing to counter it for several months and train entirely new models off of very freshly scraped data, and this is all assuming that no new architectures come out which Nightshade just doesn't generalize to, as well as that enough people actually care enough to apply it to their images (and while the paper claims to only require 2% poisoning per concept, that is actually a fairly large amount of images).

As a final note -- I would urge caution over any claims made over Nightshade's efficacy or the efficacy of any countermeasures for the time being.  There's a shitload of misinformation about Glaze as it is, but at least any effects that it has are pretty immediately obvious, so anyone who needs to know (probably people training Twitter screenshot LoRAs, I guess, based on where I see it used) ends up finding the truth soon anyways. Any effects Nightshade has take a fairly long time to manifest.  Don't be afraid to report your findings on anything, but keep in mind that general knowledge on how Nightshade works in practice is going to change rapidly over the next few weeks and anything happening within the first few weeks especially shouldn't be taken as definitive until it is repeatedly verified in testing.","reproduction instructions for nightshade  here is the dataset:  (it is actually the same as last time with the clean and poison images combined).

1dngxcy,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"AI has helped me speed up my art process and made me a better artist Hello all!

I am an artist. When I first learned of AI art I was against it for so long. Then my bf and I had a long discussion. He’s not against ai or for it. He’s neutral. However, he asked me a very interesting question that made me rethink everything.

“Does a machine think like a human?” Referring to Alan Turing. It threw me off and I had no answer. I then gave AI art a chance and spent a good amount of months learning from A1111 and settled with comfyui ((love the control it gives me)). After learning that I can colour an image with control nets, I realised… why not ask my client could I use AI to help find a colour pallette for their work and I’ll colour it in myself.

So I did.  After sketching and lining a piece, I used ai to create some colour palette scheme. 

Out of a few dozens, it gave me multiple choices and colour schemes to choose which worked best for the character and my client chose which suits them best. They were okay as long as I used it to help find a pallette. That was all I used it for. 

It saved me hours if not two days worth of figuring out a scheme. 

I just find it hilarious now so many people are anti AI saying it steals peoples work. There are some ethical issues but that happens even in traditional and digital art also. It’s baffling to see how anti AI people are due to AI when peoples art are stolen all the time - Eg. Companies stealing peoples fan art to sell on shirts or posters without credit. That’s a real issue that’s actually destroying monetary rights for artists that could save them money.

Aside from that, as an artist, I will use ai in future to help me. Hell, I’m even planning on saving up for a better GPU to use for both my art program and AI also. One plan I have is to create a model based off my own sketches for private use to create sketches of ideas for people’s work or if I’m out of ideas to create a sketch for me and then fix it myself and add stuff , such as backgrounds, cleaning up, line… whatever.

I’m an artist that’s not big at all and I’ll be making sure to use ai and its advantages to help me get better and understand my art more.

","ai has helped me speed up my art process and made me a better artist hello all 

i am an artist. when i first learned of ai art i was against it for so long. then my bf and i had a long discussion. he’s not against ai or for it. he’s neutral. however, he asked me a very interesting question that made me rethink everything.

“does a machine think like a human?” referring to alan turing. it threw me off and i had no answer. i then gave ai art a chance and spent a good amount of months learning from a1111 and settled with comfyui ((love the control it gives me)). after learning that i can colour an image with control nets, i realised… why not ask my client could i use ai to help find a colour pallette for their work and i’ll colour it in myself.

so i did.  after sketching and lining a piece, i used ai to create some colour palette scheme. 

out of a few dozens, it gave me multiple choices and colour schemes to choose which worked best for the character and my client chose which suits them best. they were okay as long as i used it to help find a pallette. that was all i used it for. 

it saved me hours if not two days worth of figuring out a scheme. 

i just find it hilarious now so many people are anti ai saying it steals peoples work. there are some ethical issues but that happens even in traditional and digital art also. it’s baffling to see how anti ai people are due to ai when peoples art are stolen all the time - eg. companies stealing peoples fan art to sell on shirts or posters without credit. that’s a real issue that’s actually destroying monetary rights for artists that could save them money.

aside from that, as an artist, i will use ai in future to help me. hell, i’m even planning on saving up for a better gpu to use for both my art program and ai also. one plan i have is to create a model based off my own sketches for private use to create sketches of ideas for people’s work or if i’m out of ideas to create a sketch for me and then fix it myself and add stuff , such as backgrounds, cleaning up, line… whatever.

I'm sick of people making themselves feel special by monopolizing art, if an AI tool destroys your passion for art you never cared about art, you cared about being special or the status that being an ""artist"" gives.
Also if the only value someone has to offer is the gatekeeping of something I'd argue whether that person is actually offering value or is just trying to promote ignorance to keep themselves at an advantage.

 The part where this person says ai should be replacing manual labor not art so artist don't get replaced is really funny to me, yeah, fuck every worker but let me keep my artist status 🤣

Honestly, these people sound like a bunch of three year olds throwing tantrums because the teacher gave the gold star to another kid

11ue2a0,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"A note on AI models ""copying"" inputs. So, I'm fairly new to the AI generation scene (honestly, who isn't at this stage?) But am definitely an enthusiast. I run stable diffusion locally and have almost 20 models, I've played around with Midjourney, I've generated thousands of images... you get the idea. I'm also friends with some artists and have definitely seen/heard a lot of the arguments about how these models simply regurgitate training data. Naturally, I was concerned, despite the fact that I *know* that's not fundamentally how such models work. So I decided to look into some of the research surrounding it.

[This]( is an interesting paper I've seen a few times at this point: It's pretty new, and contains a fairly comprehensive test of stable diffusion v 1.4. It's the source for the image that can be found in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt/comments/10qemyl/antiai\_artists\_have\_a\_new\_dear\_to\_heart\_article/). But I never see the methodology or actual content talked about beyond such snippets.

It turns out, the purpose of this project wasn't to ""prove"" that models regurgitate training data accidently/during normal use at all. It was mainly to see whether an ""extraction attack"" (ie, a targeted attempt at getting the model to reveal some of its training data) *could* be successful. Note the large difference between ""does stable diffusion simply spit training data back out during normal use?"" and ""can we get these models to spit *some* pieces of training data back out if we make a concerted effort to do so?"" (If you're wondering what the point of this is to begin with, it's because some diffusion models might require privacy/security of the training data, such as ones trained on medical data in the future).

So what was the methodology? Well, you can see it in section 4.2 -- extracting data from stable diffusion. Essentially, the researchers' process was as follows:

1. Assume images that appear many times in stable diffusion's training data are more likely to be ""regurgitated"" with the correct prompt(s).
2. Identify a large number of such images (they narrowed it down to the top 350K, or top 1 in 500 in terms of ""images that appear many times in stable diffusion's training data"") .
3. Generate a large number of images ""targeting"" each one (they generated 500 images for each of 350K, or 175 million in total).
4. Compare the generated images to the targets to see how many we're able to match reliably (ie ""successfully extract"").

What were the results? Well... essentially they identified 109 images that were near-copies of training data *and* could be reliably extracted (ie success &gt; 50 %)

109 images. Less than 1 in 3,200 if you consider the original set of 350,000 likely targets, and less than *1 in 1 million* when you consider the original set being worked with here was the entire set of 175 million training images.

They also noted that the images most likely to be extracted were those duplicated 100 times or more in the training data. This is not a case of ""stable diffusion saw this image once from a random web scrape and is spitting it back out any time someone says a specific keyword."" This is a case of ""stable diffusion saw this image hundreds, possibly thousands of times as opposed to some it only saw 10 times or 1 time, and *might* spit it out when you use a very specific prompt that closely matches the caption it was trained on.

Granted, they were only looking for reliable/repeatable near-matches, not pictures with a similar background, similar face, etc. or random one-offs. I'm not saying there's no nuance to this or that memorization of images from training data ""never"" happens.

1dlucvl,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Warm Take I seen a post from this subreddit that really has me interested in a conversation.

I am a 3D artist and animator. I would call myself mid tier. I specialize in sculpting Anthro and Mythological models. IThe most money I have ever made from a commission was $120 for two characters that totaled in at about 60 hours of work.

With that said I do work as a freelancer for 2 game studios and have current projects open that if the community likes well enough, I could get paid for the work I'm doing.

So Generative AI art. Where do I stand? Honestly, I think it's really interesting and I support the AI revolution overall. I've messed around with stable diffusion myself and had a good deal of fun with it.

I trained SD off of all of the models and art I had created over my 6 years of training and learning and used that to make some pretty interesting concepts. Creating 3D art is a steep challenge and being able to make a concept from my previous work with just a few prompts was actually really helpful as an artist.

What I think is wrong in the generative AI arena is something I think other artists would agree on. I was on Deviant Art the other day. Lots of AI art in there. People are selling the AI images for $15 - $30 let's say. The problem here is, I can tell who's art they used to make the model and it's not their work at all. This person has probably never made art or work years to make art. They used other peoples work to train the model and then they are selling the result. Now, of they weren't selling, I am 100% in support of someone else training an SD model from my art work but to take and sell it? Like they did something super difficult that took years and years of study, refinement, love, passion, and all of the hurt and pitfalls someone like myself has had to go through to get to where I am today. I don't see this as okay.

For personal use, by all means have fun. If you own all of the art and you train the model and then sell the results, that's cool as well, but to take others extremely difficult work and then sell it?

Humans get art ideas from other humans and ai is copying what humans do.

I'm assuming most of the users here are already aware of the Stable Diffusion base model created by lllyasviel called [PaintsUndo ]( generates step by step drawings of input images. This base model had the antis shook by complaining on the GitHub issues page and calling the project evil to attempting to dox lllyasviel by sharing already public information about him. It looks like they are going to be even more panicked and furious over **another** diffusion-based method that can generate time-lapse videos of artwork.

This model is called [Inverse Painting](https://inversepainting.github.io/) and it was created for Siggraph Asia 2024 by a group of researchers at the University of Washington. It uses the [ReferenceNet](https://arxiv.org/html/2311.17117v2) framework (using consistent and controllable image to video synthesis for character animation) to reconstruct a time-lapse video of how the input painting may have been painted.

The method extrapolates beyond the limited, acrylic style paintings on which it has been trained, showing plausible results for a wide range of artistic styles and genres.

Almost no one understands how AI image generators actually works, even though there has been significant progress on that if you know where to look. I keep hearing people compare it to Google image search, or that the computer is actually acting as an artist. This is no more true then that the camera is the photographer. I've seen so much trash talking, and the anger is understandable. 

I'm angry as well because AI art was there for me when I was the sickest with COVID. Even if I couldn't follow a movie/game or even stay awake long enough to engage with traditional media. I could still explore a world where I could make myself laugh. Let me tell you if you are having trouble just breathing if something, anything makes you laugh in that situation it's a blessing.

If you can look into how it actually works.
This may be from 5 years ago, but it's a very very good introduction.

Essentially AI art generators take what they learn from being trained, and they turn words,  symbols, phrases into a strange sort of dimension those dimensions can also be set to interact with other dimensions in specific ways. I like to think of prompting as navigating a higher dimensional space. I think of doing another generation as moving time forward and the different versions generated as sorts of directions. I am given 4 options in Wombo dream so it's natural to think of those in terms of the cardinal directions.

I think the most mind bending thing about AI art is that by simply sharing prompts we are kind of sharing an artistic probability space. So there is a tremendous amount of information both in the prompts and the generators. I have a theory that it's way way bigger then tree (3). This is true both for prompts and obviously for a larger extent to the generators. This is why I say it's more important then the invention of writing, because you can convey more information then was possible even using the most sophisticated algorithms available before stable diffusion and with unlimited processing power it just wouldn't have been possible to send that much information in such a small package. Generators are like the Tardis from Doctor Who. They are bigger on the inside (what is possible) then the outside (the actual code/space they take up).


I am confident that if we explain how these things actually work people won't see them as threatening as they do now. If we want a good outcome then we should be advocating for this technology to be available to as many people as possible. The situation we are in right now where people pay monthly fees isn't good enough. There should be the processing power available even on a smartphone to do everything on the device itself. That's the direction things should be going. Instead with the way things are trending I believe that only corporations/ nation-states will have access.

12ggffj,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Posting AI art on reddit and the toxicity This post was initially meant to be a reply to [this post]( But I thought it might be useful to share my experience as a post. 

I've had many AI art top posts in big non-AI subs, but it wasn't so simple.

Firstly, let me shamelessly plug my subreddit r/AICharacterDrawing. you can browse art request posts for specific characters to attempt and make them with AI (or other methods) or you can request a character of your own you'd like others to make. Now, let's get to the real stuff.

Initially, most of my posts were removed, even in subreddits that didn't have any explicit anti-AI rules. The mods would often come up with ridiculous excuses to take down my post, like in one instance where a mod essentially said, ""I'm removing it because the people hated it, and we listen to the community, even if you didn't break any rules."" This same mod was angry that I took credit for my work, even though I did say that it I used AI. I believe they didn't appreciate me saying that I worked on it because it made the issue more nuisanced and made it harder for them to view AI in a black and white, ""AI is absolutely bad and lazy"" lens.

I usually make it a point to read the rules of a subreddit before posting anything. However, if you dig deep enough, you'll almost always find some sort of anti-AI rule. Some subreddits have low-effort rules without specifying AI.

Most of my work is heavily edited with Photoshop, image-to-image, and inpainting, which requires a huge amount of effort, not to mention creative vision, (which many of them deny we have, and claim it's just the computer), and lot of my work starts from basic drawings or pictures I take to get my vision made. So I don't think my posts qualify as low effort. Despite this, some subreddits removed my work for low effort, even though I discussed with them that it wasn't low effort. Unfortunately, they ignored me and didn't bother to respond.

But here's how I got success: ask!
When posting in a new sub, I started telling the mods what I planned to post and asked for their permission before posting anything unless there was a rule that specifically allowed AI. While many subreddits outright reject such requests, and soms may be rude. Some will allow it but will provide you with additional rules, such as the work being edited or specific posting days. I even started doing this before beginning some of my works since they take hours or even days to complete, and it would be disappointing not to be able to share them with the intended community.


Despite the success of those posts, or perhaps because of it, I've received loads of hate and toxicity in the comments. It's gotten to a point where it has slightly impacted my mental health. The amount of hate, hostility, and outright lies those people spew can be quite depressing. If you plan on posting AI art on those subs, my advice is to ignore toxic comments and block whoever wrote them. Engaging in a civil discussion with them has led me nowhere, and their responses will vary between ""your work is trash,"" ""you didn't do anything, it's all AI,"" ""AI is theft,"" and so on. Ironically, they will praise the AI beyond its capabilities just to attack you and claim that you didn't do anything and shouldn't take any credit. When I challeng them to recreate a similar work using their text-to-image AI of choice ( i always make this challenge), no one took me up on my offer to this day because they know they can't. So, I've found it best to ignore and block rather than engage.

That said, many many people were positive, praising the work for what it is and there are some that were actively defending the use of AI (they get downvoted of course). 

that's all, good luck out there!","posting ai art on reddit and the toxicity this post was initially meant to be a reply to  this post]( but i thought it might be useful to share my experience as a post.

178x064,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Why I See AI as a Powerful Tool for Artists.  

As an artist and physicist who has dabbled in both traditional and digital media, I've come to appreciate the power of AI in augmenting creativity. I wanted to share my thoughts because I've noticed a recurring debate about the 'authenticity' of AI-assisted art.

First off, let's acknowledge that artists have always used the latest tools and technologies to advance their craft. From the invention of oil paints to the camera obscura, tools have extended what's possible in art. In that same vein, I see AI as an amplifier of human creativity, not a substitute.  
 The rise of AI in the art world has spawned numerous debates, including claims that AI ""steals"" from human creativity. This argument often neglects the role of entropy in this universe, which inherently prevents perfect copies in any system. Based on the principles of thermodynamic, AI serves as an 'entropy modifier' that introduces complexity and novelty, preserving the essence and originality of each art piece for inspiration.   
 I speak from personal experience when I say that these debates have consequences. I've been subject to what feels like a 'witch hunt,' accused of undermining the 'soul' of art by incorporating AI into my process. This has been disheartening and, frankly, feels soulless in itself. The focus on tools rather than the emotional and conceptual core of art misses the point entirely. 

I've found that AI helps me break free from my limitations. It allows me to focus more on the conceptual elements of my work—my artistic vision—rather than being bogged down by technical constraints. For me, this technology opens up avenues to create larger, more intricate pieces that would have been unfeasible otherwise.

There's a notion that utilizing AI somehow detracts from the 'human' aspect of art. But isn't every tool controlled by a human? The data I feed into the AI, the algorithms I choose to use, and the modifications I make to its output all come from me. They are extensions of my creative intent, rendered through advanced technology.

At the end of the day, what makes art resonant is not the tool used to create it, but the emotion, concept, and vision behind it. And if a tool like AI can help us better realize that vision, why not embrace it?

I'm curious to hear what others think. Are you open to using AI in your artistic process, or do you have reservations? Let's discuss!","why i see ai as a powerful tool for artists

additionally, i kinda starting to hate people who screams at me to “pick up a pencil” like they were my mom or a police officer. some of my friends were like this. i was (severely) struggling with drawing anatomy, but lately, drawing has been turning into like a chore that could get my fingers hurt. besides, i don’t think it’s even good anyway ([see for urself]( i guess). i guess this what happens when i relied too much on ai when i make anime portraits.

anyway, sorry if none of this made any sense. i just wanna let my feelings out on ai hate on the internet and everything.","['age', 'occupation']","['ai', 'gpt', 'old', 'police officer']"

I literally just pointed out that the perception that ai cannot reach that level of accuracy was wrong and that there is this idea that ai has a very ""recognizable style"" when we have proof that even machines have a hard time distinguishing ai art from human made art.

1c81j4g,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"You can be both Pro Artist and Pro AI As much as the popular discourse around AI would lead us to believe these two things are mutually exclusive, I don't believe this is the case at all. 

The problems with AI and Art are most problematic in the context of neo-capitalism. If Coca-Cola decides to utilize an unpaid intern to generate AI graphics, I think that is morally corrupt and not just savy business strictly because any cash they would pay an artist is less than a drop in the ocean compared to how much capital they have access to. 

Now when you start applying these same metrics to small businesses or individuals then it becomes a much more nuanced conversation, and it's something I'm currently trying to work out myself. 

In my own life, I've spent thousands of dollars on artists work. I run a creative business and I pay a graphic designer about $300 per graphic to create images specifically for my business. I could do this myself with AI, but I believe it's important to support artists if I can afford to, and so I do. For the same business, I needed a jingle and rather than use royalty free music or AI, I paid a musician a few hundred dollars to write me something. 

As a hobby I've always enjoyed writing. I write screenplays, short stories, essays, and even comics. Comics is a new thing. For those who have never attempted to make money as a writer it's very difficult to do, and you're also limited in terms of what you can write about. 

If you had a story in a high fantasy setting or a space opera then you are wasting your time trying to get a movie made if you're not already famous because of how expensive it is. So your choices are essentially to write a screenplay nobody will read, write the story or post it online for free and maybe someone reads it, or you write a book that will take forever and there is a high chance that nobody reads it. 

This is why comic books are cool. They're more like screenplays then they are like books, but they're much more affordable to make then a film. 

But for the average person, that doesn't matter. I've reached out to artists and inquired about collaborating on a story and the lowest quote I received for a one issue was close to $3,000. If I don't have the cash, I could crowdfund it but that involves running a online campaign and tone of other work for a single 30 page issue. 

A simpler option is to use AI and release for free online. Now nobody is getting hurt. It's not taking away jobs from anyone. It's just producing narrative art that otherwise would not have existed outside of my own mind. 

For whatever reason, this is cardinal sin to some people. It doesn't matter that I've spent thousands of dollars supporting authors, that I always go to my local comic store instead of buying books on amazon, or that in a perfect world it could lead to a book that would end up employing an artist. 

This is the essence of why I enjoy this subreddit. Producing any kind of AI art feels like swimming against the tide a bit. There is so much disillusion with the current state of the world that even something as innocent as AI art can serve as a lightning rod for peoples frustration with it. 

It's gotten so bad, I don't even attach my real name to these projects out of fear of backlash, and want I would like for others to understand is that even though I use AI to make art, I am still entirely supportive of artists who don't. I wish I had the talent to draw, but unfortunately I only was given the skill the write. If I could afford to hire someone I would, but I can't so I don't. 

All of these conversations are so new that I don't think many people have fully developed their opinion on these things yet. For that reason, I think its important to voice the ones that are sympathetic to both sides of the argument so we can ultimately come to a mutual understanding and agreement about how we can best move forward together.

18hcotx,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"10 Reasons AI art makes the world a better place 1. Access Visualization for All.
AI Art provides everyone, regardless of income, ability or time constraints an opportunity
to visualize their dreams and ideas. Previously if you want to visualize something you need to
either study art, pay an artist or search for similar concepts. Expressing emotions, sentiments and concepts in visual form now requires only proficiency in expressing the concept in text form compatible with AI art generator(e.g. negative prompt refinement).
AI art removes most barriers to visual content creation.

2.Reduction in pollution and chemical use vs traditional art/photography,
Paints, pencils, canvases, paper and photo, all require massive industrial production of
 art/photo equipment, from batteries to pencil leads. Pollution  and
environmental damage is prevented with each AI image.


3.Health benefits:
Chemical exposure to toxic art/photo  supplies is eliminated.
RSI, tendonitis and tissue damage due art practice is eliminated.
Risks of accidents due travel for photo/art purposes is eliminated.

4.Reduction of associated costs:
The transport/storage/packaging of art/photo supplies/equipment  is removed.
Photo creation:
Traveling, hiring models, photography setup and camera maintaince are eliminated vs AI generated photos. The expenses of travel alone massively increase human productibity.
Traditional:
No art supplies or material expenses. Eliminates costs associated with references, materials and general travel/storage/display costs.
Digital:
Eliminates costly subscriptions, tutorials and programs. While graphics cards are expensive,
many online services allow free image creation and most AI artists are not using local AI.

5.Productivity:
AI art is undeniably much faster in producing content.
Time spent at creating AI art is focused on direct production, rather than
 learning skills or techniques. Learning AI art techniques(prompting, model parameters,
upscaling,controlnet) is much easier and has no intrinsic talent requirements.

6.Reduces costs/labor of art assets for products:
Videogames, websites, software and generally all graphics-dependent products no 
longer have to scramble for free assets or produce their specific content in-house.
The content production pipeline is greatly simplified and eliminates associated costs/labor/time
 spent designing/commisioning/adapting content.

7.Allows to explore vast oceans of untapped content:
AI art allows to explore at near-zero cost the entire space of ""possible art"",
with guided or random prompting, anyone can have endless content to view and
 use. The amount of images inside latent space of Stable Diffusion alone, is far above anything humanity can produce with digital/traditional means. 

8.Understanding art and pictures in general:
AI generators can convert images back into text form for exploration of themes, art styles,
artistic influences and composition. These descriptors are no longer gatekept by creative
 class, allowing anyone to find out exact styles/techniques/references used in specific image
 to replicate or transform such ideas in their abstract category.
Before:
You need art education, attention to detail, massive expirience in content curation and
 art history to identify style/technique/period/influences of specific art piece.
Now:
img2text,gpt4V and similar software can do it automatically and much faster.

9.Increasing the amount of quality art/Rising baseline of ""good enough"".
Before AI art, every low-quality art piece, every photo was valued due its opportunity/labor 
costs, with quality being secondary to presentation/context.
AI art has removed the opportunity/labor costs for content production, making low-quality
 content non-viable in principle: crayon drawings, casual photos, scribbles,etc no longer 
have prestige or recognition as ""good enough material"".
The baseline, default level of quality and aesthetic requirements are rising each months,
as quality content is inevitably produced at much higher rates than amateur photo/art. 

10.Raising aesthethic sensitivity and refinement of culture:
Before AI art, the non-creative public was no engaged with content creation and was 
only consuming curated content(TV,media, art galleries, art websites,etc): culture was
 exlusively created within gatekept institutions and ideological circles.
With content creation tools now easily accessible to all, the collective aesthethic refinement
 process has begun and creative class can no longer gatekeep ""aethethic creation"".
Anyone now can establish  an equivalent of 'art movemnt', 'new aesthethic',
'art genre', 'art direction', 'new style'  with zero costs, democratizing ""Culture creation"" towards
 personalized cultural sphere(personal micro-aesthethic ) that can be promoted and
shared with people who support it: no longer can creative class dictate and gatekeep culture,
with AI art anyone can design their own culture/subculture/genre that aligns with their
own personal values and ideas.","10 reasons ai art makes the world a better place 1  access visualization for all.

Yes I'm able to paint photorealistic paintings by a hand, but I always hated the process so I left classical, digital art niche many years ago and started to code my own Generative music softs.

As a person who have good understanding of anatomy and composition I still love to sketch sometimes, but I hate to do details so I really love the idea about generative Ai art.

So I want to get back in to game as a digital artist, but I have some questions about legal issues involving Ai generative art.

1.  As I understand AI-generated work in not copyrightable. Right?

2.  Is it legal to sell Ai-generated art if you don't have copyrights of created artwork.

3.  If it is not copyrightable can I sell Ai-generated art as NFT? Is it legal?

4.  As I understand you can't actually be an Artist if you have no copyrights of created artwork. So by definition ""Ai Artist"" as profession does not exists?

5. ""The US Copyright Office will consider an AI-generated work copyrightable if a human can prove they themselves put a meaningful amount of creative effort into the final content."" - What does it mean?

6.  What if I don't live in US? Can I sell the artwork by simply changing my geolocation? lol 

I don't expect you to answer all of my questions. 

Please let me know if there is better subreddit where to ask about it.

Thank you!","according to the copyright law there is no such a thing as ai artist ?? hello!  i'm a programmer and artist.

yes i'm able to paint photorealistic paintings by a hand, but i always hated the process so i left classical, digital art niche many years ago and started to code my own generative music softs.

as a person who have good understanding of anatomy and composition i still love to sketch sometimes, but i hate to do details so i really love the idea about generative ai art.

so i want to get back in to game as a digital artist, but i have some questions about legal issues involving ai generative art.

1dl8yfp,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"My very niche game on Steam frequently gets negative feedback solely due to AI use Hi everyone, I released a very niche, horror visual novel on Steam a few months ago. I made the game in my spare time and put a ton of work into it (music, sfx, writing, programming). I used AI only to generate some of the visuals, but I did a ton of tweaking in Photoshop and drawing by hand. And, I purposely did not try to mimic anyone's style. (I have an art background. I used AI simply to speed up my process, since I don't have a lot of free time.) Anyway, very early on, I had a well-know Youtube gamer rip into my game for its AI use, as if I was a triple-A game developer, and not one person selling my indie game for $1. This really hurt views/sales. The video has 40+ comments of people shitting on AI usage rather than talking about the game. And, despite openly saying that I use A.I. in the Steam game description, I still get people writing bad reviews due to the AI, as if I tricked them, even though some concede to liking the game. It's frustrating. It makes me want to redo all of the visuals by hand, but this would be incredibly time-consuming, and I doubt it would earn more money (like I said, it's a niche game). I also find it ironic because of lot of highly rated games use the same free game assets and no one says anything.

Anyway, I received another bad review yesterday due to A.I. use:

*""I got this game without reading the fine print about it using AI art. Just disappointing to see.*  
*The story itself was interesting, it would have had potential.""*

It's not even in fine print, but right below the main description. So here I am, venting. I *do* understand the hate if the work is lazy and obviously ripping artists off. But, I suspect there are a lot of creators who do not fit this mold, who are nonetheless being penalized. I'm wondering if anyone else has been dealing with this.

Big corporations will do their calculations and use and invest in AI, some online bullying won't stop them.

It does still involve skills and knowledge. And fewer people using it for their own work will just mean there are fewer non-professionals who are able to, that will feed in less to the open source communities and the development will shift more towards closed and paid tools.

Nothing is going to stop big movie studios for example, from embracing a technology that can replace $10M VFX shots with something much cheaper, not as it is now, but we've all seen what AI video looks like today vs. 18 months ago.

Many are basically put together by a producer. A few hugely popular bands these days are actually a few people who just got together to make music. But think of how that would shift if everyone was always shitting on every band they see. How many fewer kids would pick up a guitar and learn it.

Ironically by attacking all AI art as corporate and soulless they are pushing it further that way.

Part of this point of how I / we see AI art is that I (or we) are bound to frame AI art (as tool) differently in say 5 years (maybe 20 years) than we do now. 

What prompted this post was my considering pro artists do not need AI as a tool. And smirking on that train of thought. As in they’d be fine as artists in a world without AI. But I sense for high production pro artists it’s at times welcomed to take a 6 hour process and wrap it up in an hour, with AI. 

Whereas my doing same job that pro artist does in 6 hours may be more like 3 weeks for me, with lots of time spent dealing with artist’s block. Pros, I imagine have ingrained workarounds to deal with those in minutes or even seconds. Whereas I might need a day or three on some of those issues. 

It would be untruthful for me to say I’m not a pro artist, but I am certainly not at pro level on most forms of art, and on many am closer to novice. With AI, 2D illustration art comes up more often than not, and I’m not a professional in that medium, nor do I strive to be. 

Current (or even 2022) AI allows me illusion I could be pro illustration artist in short order, if I wanted to be. I do see it as illusion because of how much pre and post (human) processing I see as likely involved even with AI included. I feel this is true with most traditional arts, in that humans utilizing AI of the professional variety will still need or benefit from acquired skills and experience to help with talents in crafting professional levels of output. 

What I see changing is tools that help with other parts of process, and I think that development is well underway but also 2-20 years away from essentially being more robust platforms. 

I don’t see pro artists needing that and are fine just about any way it plays out, including the unlikely scenario where artists can’t use AI for professional, commercial output. I see temptation being very high for any human interested in a form of art and AI tools being there to augment part of the process with AI speed. This is why I see need to defend AI art. The temptation to do high quality, professional level output is worthy of defense, particularly if one is tuned into idea that we will all frame AI and AI art differently than we do in this era of emerging AI. 

I somewhat think this current era is great for novices to participate in art markets with output. And for everyone short of pros, that can be disconcerting that novices have that much pull, suddenly, in the marketplace. It seems less great with how much saturation could happen, but is the trade off. Yet, even this aspect of how we curate output in the open markets is bound to get an AI influence.  Or three.

I hate when people are against something yet didn’t ever bother to learn or read about it at all. Like. If you are gonna hate something, at least do it properly. Hate it due to actual info and not something you think you know. Then say to those who do know they are wrong. 

Just had a conversation where someone said I “clearly” didn’t know what I was talking about. As if I didn’t spend 2 years studying this. 

Can someone tell me, how do AI image generators work? 

Cause all I’ve seen from anti ai people is them saying “oh. It takes images then cuts them apart and puts them together.” Which I know isn’t true at all. Yet I get people hating on me for saying it. 
—————————-

(Also can come one define “machine learning”? 

Cause someone anti ai told me that “it’s not called machine learning cause it learns like a human. That’s moronic.” Cause. Pretty sure it does.) 

(Also. Am I wrong? Cause I said in response to that:


“Tell me this. How does a human learn? Through failure and adapting. Through recognition of patterns and links. 

That’s what “machine learning” is. A system of machines that can learn from data and unseen data. The more it experiences, the more it adapts and learns. Through trial and error. 

Thus. Producing predictions and results using data given. And adapting to unseen data. Random events. Etc. It is a system in ai, specifically designed to learn from data it is given. Growing better with every change, every test, every new piece of info that is given. 

It uses algorithm and to recognize patterns and links in data. Then it makes a predication/result based upon these. In this case, links to phrases in the prompts given, to examples it already was given prior. Which it then stored to use again. 

Like us. Humans recognize patterns. We make connections. It’s how we learn. How did you learn to read English? Someone came and correlated to you, words to what you saw. Then you as a human, began to do this on your own. It’s how we learn other languages, linking different words, ones we know, and ones that mean the same thing in another language. Or in the case of art. We, see pictures of art, we see how they are made, see these connections and patterns then do it ourselves. (How do you know you are seeing a device when you replied to me? Someone once told you, or you saw someone say, “this is a device for communication” or anything of a similar meaning.) 

Main difference is. Humans become self dependent on learning. We learn on our own. An AI, is fed information to learn from, by us. Albeit. Ai Mainly, (currently) through text and visual imprints. 


Machine learning also comes in many forms. Learning differently like us. Supervision. We tell it the patterns. Semi supervised, we tell it then leave it be to recognize the pattern, unsupervised, where it will need to learn to recognize patterns it’s own. 

Like a human. Some need supervision at the beginning to see the patterns and link stuff. Some, need less support. And some don’t. 


We humans do this. We take in information through our sense and act accordingly after recognizing how others do so. Then making a decision from it. 

Take a kid. They did something wrong, but they through it was right from learning from others. Eg. They see their parents make something or use tools, etc. but they have not learnt the dangers. As such, they mimic the behavior based on what they know. When they do it wrong, their parents tell them

13231ix,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Response to the ""How AI Art Works"" infographic **The infographic in question: 

The experiment shown in the infographic is a  useless test, this is like training a computer weather model on just two storms and then demonstrating that it predicts those two storms verbatim, and then poorly interpolates between those two storm systems when asked to do anything else. Of course it will essentially reproduce the training data with such a test. But real weather models are taking billions of data points, and actually *modelling* how the data works in a way that generalizes. Same with language and computer vision models.

Even if you believe it is just interpolation, the *best* way to interpolate is for some sort of intelligence to emerge, and to actively avoid blind ""averaging"" techniques that don't work. I believe that neural networks likely produce some sort of higher-level concept web to come to the most efficient way to model the training data. The larger the model, the more human-like the abstractions become, until it is doing something vaguely resembling a human creative process &mdash; although I can't say it's quite there yet.

It's notoriously difficult to peer into the neural network to see if it really has a specific unique insight about the training data, but AI researchers do know how to spot and avoid the problem of neural model over-fitting. The author of this infographic is essentially saying that some combination of over-fitting and simple interpolation is what AI models *always* do, which is patently false.

That being said, I partially agree with one component of the copyright argument this infographic is making, particularly the idea that these can legally be thought of as remixing tools. But remixing tools are not always infringing, and are certainly not unethical just by merit of being a remix. The doctrine of fair use has sided in favor of many remixing methods and tools, because there is an understanding in courts that remixing is an important way we advance culture and art.","response to the  how ai art works"" infographic **the infographic in question:

183u221,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"I'm writing an essay on the legitimacy of AI art, how did I do on explaining the technology? While there are many different image generation models, each with their own technologies and architecture, modern image generators all utilize deep learning, a subset of machine learning techniques that are based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Let’s define some terms, machine learning is the field of AI that aims to teach computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task. An artificial neural network is a collection of nodes, or neurons, that connect to form layers, their architecture being inspired by the human brain, with nodes able to send signals between each other. This artificial neural network uses representation learning, a concept where a model automatically discovers and extracts meaningful features from raw data without explicitly being told what to look for. The “deep” in deep learning refers to the depth, or complexity of the layers in the neural network. Now that our terms are defined, let’s look at an example. If I gave you different sets of images and told you to identify what was in the images, you would have no problem doing it. But what if I gave you a sheet of paper filled with code? This is how AI sees images, just pixel values for red, green, and blue. You would just have to make a guess. Which is what the computer does too, at first. You could go through a thousand rounds of this and never get better at it, but the computer would figure out a method that works eventually.

To understand that one arrangement of pixels is a pea, and another arrangement is a tomato, the AI needs metrics that help separate these images in mathematical space. At first, this is done by hand by a programmer. Let’s say we want the model to measure the amount of yellow in the image, it will put the banana and the pea opposite of each other in a one-dimensional space. But what if we get an image of a fresh, green tomato? Color is no longer enough to differentiate between them, so let’s add an axis for size. We now have a two-dimensional space with the yellow objects to the right, and the large objects at the top. But when we put in a million images of tomatoes and peas, we could come across a massive pea. We would need another variable then, let's say the presence of a stem. Now we have a three-dimensional space that our images should theoretically fall into somewhere. But what if we want our model to recognize not just peas and tomatoes, but *everything* else? We need a lot more variables. This process of adding manual rules is time-consuming and open to human bias, so what if we had the computer find its own metrics? That’s exactly what deep learning algorithms do as they go through all the training data. They find variables that help improve their performance on a task, and in the process, they build out a mathematical, multi-dimensional space called latent space. These hundreds of axis would contain variables humans wouldn’t even have names for, and we certainly can’t comprehend more than 3 dimensions. This leads to the neural network of an AI being referred to as a “black box” as we can’t understand exactly how they function; however, the result is that the space for tomatoes has meaningful clusters of the characteristics that make up a tomato. Similar concepts are stored near each other, so it has a space for snow, and a space for globes, and has snow globes somewhere in the middle. Any particular location or point in this space holds what can be thought of as a “recipe” or “instructions” for creating a certain image. This “recipe” is called the latent image patch, and your text prompt is what navigates you to that location. But how do we translate this location in computer-space to an actual image?

There are a few different methods to do this, but today we will look at diffusion, which is what the most popular image generators such as DALL-E, MidJourney, and DreamStudio use. Diffusion uses a “de-noising” algorithm to remove noise from an image and return it to its original state. Programmers did this by having an AI add ten percent noise to an image, and then learn how to reverse the process. The computer adds noise to the image, attempts to remove it, and then compares its solution to the de-noised image, the “correct answer.” Eventually, it became proficient at removing ten percent of noise from images. So, they increased it to twenty percent, and it quickly mastered that too. Eventually, they increased the noise to one hundred percent and told the model to return to the original image. The AI generated an image that didn’t exist before, it was nowhere to be found in the training data. When you use an image generator, your image will start off as this one hundred percent random noise. Your text prompt serves as the “correct answer”, telling the model what the final image should look like. As the model attempts to it gradually transforms the noise into an image it uses another model to ensure the generated image matches the text prompt at each point in the diffusion.","i m writing an essay on the legitimacy of ai art, how did i do on explaining the technology? while there are many different image generation models, each with their own technologies and architecture, modern image generators all utilize deep learning, a subset of machine learning techniques that are based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. let’s define some terms, machine learning is the field of ai that aims to teach computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task. an artificial neural network is a collection of nodes, or neurons, that connect to form layers, their architecture being inspired by the human brain, with nodes able to send signals between each other. this artificial neural network uses representation learning, a concept where a model automatically discovers and extracts meaningful features from raw data without explicitly being told what to look for. the “deep” in deep learning refers to the depth, or complexity of the layers in the neural network. now that our terms are defined, let’s look at an example. if i gave you different sets of images and told you to identify what was in the images, you would have no problem doing it. but what if i gave you a sheet of paper filled with code? this is how ai sees images, just pixel values for red, green, and blue. you would just have to make a guess. which is what the computer does too, at first. you could go through a thousand rounds of this and never get better at it, but the computer would figure out a method that works eventually.

I stopped engaging with Google Translate enthusiasts on the topic of whether machine translation is ethically and legally okay long ago. But before I did, I experienced and observed every attempt at justifying, gaslighting, and straight-up lying to try and make linguists and translators who've been exploited by this billionaire-sponsored technology doubt their position. I want to share my observations and explain why the entire pro-Google Translate argument literally cannot be correct. Hopefully, this can ease some of the stress and frustration experienced by people who are still actively engaging with Google Translate enthusiasts, and even those that have stepped away but still have the topic pop up on their screens or in their thoughts. You would never argue with a flat earther or a Holocaust denier because you are 100% certain they are wrong, I want to instill the same mentality toward Google Translate enthusiasts.

To summarize: The entire pro-Google Translate argument consists of two general positions, I'll call them Position A and Position B. Each position individually is massively flawed when scrutinized even a little bit, so Google Translate enthusiasts employ both simultaneously depending on where the discussion is centered. The simple fact that these positions contradict each other renders their entire, and I mean ENTIRE, stance as empty bullshit.

Let's dig into it:

Position A: The pseudo-philosophical position that Google Translate learns and translates just like the human mind. Use: Position A is used to draw a 1:1 comparison between a machine translation algorithm and the mind of a sentient, living being. This comparison is used as justification for why copyright enforcement cannot apply to machine translation and why no laws or regulations should ever be applied to the tech. They carefully use terms like ""learning,"" ""understanding,"" and ""generating"" to anthropomorphize Google Translate in daily discussions, and it's purposeful.

Example: When a linguist or translator points out that their copyrighted work was used to train Google Translate, the Google Translate enthusiast uses Position A to say ""Google Translate doesn't copy your work, it merely learns from it, then generates translations from what it learned just like every human translator has done forever. If you consider that copyright infringement, then every dictionary, thesaurus, or other reference material that inspired or taught you is also copyright infringement.""

Why Position A fails individually: If we are to accept that Google Translate functions just like a human brain and is literally capable of learning, thinking, and translating, then everything it produces is property of Google Translate and not the user. By taking this position, the Google Translate enthusiast can seemingly defeat the copyright argument, but they are simultaneously admitting that they are simply requesting a sentient entity that learns and translates to make something for them with exactly zero contribution from the user. This means Google Translate-generated translations cannot be owned and sold by the user, it means they are by definition not a translator or linguist. To take it to an extreme, accepting Google Translate as a learning, thinking, and translating entity implies that governments should be having discussions about giving this entity rights and protections like we do with humans and animals. That's how idiotic Position A gets if you take it seriously.

Position B: The technologically based position that Google Translate is just a tool, a product no different from a dictionary or a thesaurus. Use: Position B is used to dismiss the loss of employment in fields scraped by Google Translate as an inevitable progress of technology. The implication is that throughout history, humans have advanced, and those advancements have made many careers obsolete, and Google Translate is no different. It is also used to separate any nefarious and unethical elements from Google Translate, with the implication that a tool is neither good nor bad, and linguists and translators should simply shut up and learn to use the tool instead of trying to ""fight human progress.""

Example: When a linguist or translator points out the current and future damage Google Translate is doing to their career as well as the rest of the world (inaccurate translations, loss of cultural nuance, etc.), Position B is used to imply it is all emotion and hysterics from a Luddite that is against progress. By constantly equating Google Translate with a dictionary or a thesaurus, they are trying to gaslight you into doubting your very real feelings about a very real unethical industry, because you've likely used a dictionary or a thesaurus in your life.

Why Position B fails individually: By admitting that Google Translate is not a learning, thinking, and translating entity but is instead simply a tool and product, they are admitting this product was in fact made with copyrighted content from millions of non-consenting people. A for-profit product cannot be made using copyrighted content without agreement/permission from the copyright holder. Yet that is exactly how Google Translate was made, the product literally does not exist in its current form without the use of millions of copyrighted works.

Finally, why Position A and Position B are contradictory and fail together: Google Translate cannot simultaneously be an entity that learns, thinks, and translates while also being a mindless tool/product simply being used by the hands of an entity that learns, thinks, and translates. It's one or the other, and as I've explained, each position fails ethically, logically, and legally on their own. Both must be used to even attempt to argue in favor of this predatory technology. And we all know that no argument that relies on two totally contradictory positions should ever be taken seriously.

Conclusion: This post might be a waste of time, it's long-winded as hell, and most people may not read through it. BUT this realization helped me to avoid the pull of getting into it with some disingenuous Google Translate enthusiast online or IRL, because I have 100% confidence that they are simply wrong, and their arguments are meaningless attempts to personally justify laziness, entitlement, and straight-up theft from the working class. No matter how many technical terms are thrown at you, or how many comparisons to the human mind are made, you should be able to have complete confidence that it's all verbose bullshit, and instead of spending your time arguing or even considering these disingenuous arguments, you can focus on your language skills and pursuing your goals. Keep your dictionaries sharp and pay the prompt monkeys no mind. Even if you don't ""make it"" in the language field, you'll have spent your time on this planet in this physical form bettering yourself and developing skills and work ethic. No amount of translations generated with greasy fingers hitting keys will ever be worth a fraction of that.","satire: the entire pro-google translate argument consists of two completely contradictory stances that must both be held simultaneously to have even a semblance of being  correct"". remember this and you'll never need to argue with a single google translate bro again.  i stopped engaging with google translate enthusiasts on the topic of whether machine translation is ethically and legally okay long ago. but before i did, i experienced and observed every attempt at justifying, gaslighting, and straight-up lying to try and make linguists and translators who've been exploited by this billionaire-sponsored technology doubt their position. i want to share my observations and explain why the entire pro-google translate argument literally cannot be correct. hopefully, this can ease some of the stress and frustration experienced by people who are still actively engaging with google translate enthusiasts, and even those that have stepped away but still have the topic pop up on their screens or in their thoughts. you would never argue with a flat earther or a holocaust denier because you are 100% certain they are wrong, i want to instill the same mentality toward google translate enthusiasts.

1964ij1,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"I have a theory on why AI art and generative AI in general is just so contentious. It is cuz it doesn't have a face. Wait, that's it? Yeah people have the power to feel sorry for robots actually.

[SCIENCE
New study finds it’s harder to turn off a robot when it’s begging for its life](

[People in a new study struggled to turn off a robot when it begged them not to: 'I somehow felt sorry for him'](https://www.businessinsider.com/robot-begs-people-not-to-turn-it-off-study-2018-8)

What the f? So a person can basically be more hesitant to shut off a butt because it begged for its life but it doesn't have a life.

It's because it has a face or more specifically it feels like a person. It's called anthropomorphization I think.

Basically Make it a person.

The first step is to give it a face so when you're talking with the AI there will be animation that makes it look like it's thinking every time you generate an image. Next, use pronouns. People want to hear pronouns like you for example so you could have phrases like

> Look what I made for you

That makes it sound less like a butt and more like a child who drew a picture for you.

There should also be an opportunity for people to punch in their name. Probably in the settings.

With this it will call you by your name sometimes.

> Look Jeff, look what I made for you.

The next part would be to add some questions.

> Look Jeff, look what I made for you. Do you like it? I can make changes if you want.

Then you'll be given a list of commands that you can use very similar to how mid journey functions right now.so it will ask you what you want to do and then you can pick one of the items and then create the edit and then once again the animation for thinking and then responding with

> Okay, I'm done with the edits. Do you like it?

All of these little things such as making it sound more like a person and making it sound like a person who wants to connect with you and stuff like that could possibly warm people up to the idea.

Yes, a lot of it is just pre-programmed phrases for certain things so it's not like it would be a huge processing power.

I'm imagining something like mid journey but I suppose it could also be the case for something like dalle 3 or some other project.

I just think it should have a face because we know that people are going to stop turning off a bot for some reason even though it doesn't have a life.","i have a theory on why ai art and generative ai in general is just so contentious  it is cuz it doesn't have a face. wait, that's it? yeah people have the power to feel sorry for robots actually.

1g869g7,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"By integrating SD into gameplay, we've created the game with the most playable characters in the world. Hello everyone! I want to drop a post here to introduce our new game a little bit and also our way of **integrating SD into a larger workflow**. Hope it can be an inspiration for fellow SD users & devs, or at least provide a glimpse of how this technology might be used in future gaming industry.

Here's our game’s Steam page: [Echo of Mobius]( It's in a demo version right now and **it's FREE**. Please add us to your wishlist if you're interested in future updates. Much appreciated!

Generative AI is increasingly involved in game development, but it's often used just to generate assets more efficiently, which can lack originality. We believe new technology should enable gameplay that wasn't possible before. So instead of using AI to create fixed assets, we've **introduced a feature that lets players create ANY character they can imagine**. With a single line of description, our AI workflow brings characters to life—from appearance to backstory, personality, and profession. These characters can evolve upon reaching certain levels (like Pokémon). We're building a user-generated content ecosystem where players can encounter, fight, and recruit each other's creations, and even create DnD-style adventures through a similar AI workflow. Think of it as a real RPG version of Character AI.

In the week since our demo release, over **4,257** characters have been created, and the number is growing rapidly. Each of them is complete, playable, and unique.

We applied Stable Diffusion (SD) to generate characters' appearances, facing two main challenges: turning images into **usable game assets** and creating **consistent evolution stages** for characters. Since SD outputs standard images, we needed additional steps like background removal, which was challenging due to intricate details. To address this, we fine-tuned SD with images on a vibrant green background and applied background removal algorithms to create character sprites. Maintaining consistency across evolution stages was surprisingly manageable. We used the same set of prompts and three sets of corresponding character designs at different stages, set a slightly higher LoRA scale, and achieved good results. The slightly higher LoRA scale is also beneficial for keeping the empty green background for better background-removal processes.

Some metrics:

* **Base model**: SDXL (we tried SD3 but it wasn't ideal; we'll try FLUX soon)
* **Fine-tuning data**: 30 images of our original art per model
* **Caption prefix**: ""A full-body TOK game character on a green background, ""
* **LoRA scale**: 0.7

We hope this experience is valuable to the community. Any feedback or suggestions on our game or AI models are welcome.","by integrating sd into gameplay  we've created the game with the most playable characters in the world. hello everyone! i want to drop a post here to introduce our new game a little bit and also our way of **integrating sd into a larger workflow**. hope it can be an inspiration for fellow sd users & devs, or at least provide a glimpse of how this technology might be used in future gaming industry.

Specifically, I am looking at how the various functions of Stable Diffusion (CFG, Samplers, Model fine-tuning etc) can be given a physical method of control that non-programmers can understand - such as CFG becoming the 'chaos lever'

I use AI, think critically before getting your panties in a twist. the only part that i think is theft is the actual scrubbing of data (images, text, etc.). there is no line in the sand for ai yet because it's a very recent thing and applying past precedent is messy, but i think if your content is being used to build these AI models then you should be entitled to some form of compensation, how this would work, I'm not entirely sure because the amount of data used by these companies is astronomical, but if they are making billions or even trillions, then I am sure something could be worked out. the only time generation becomes theft, imo, is when someone is straight up copying someone else's work or their likeness. you can like something, think it's cool, and still be aware of the nuance of the situation. So no, merely using ai to generate random pictures is not theft, knowingly copying someone's art seems like it is, ripping heaps of data seems like theft. we don't like when bezo's steals our data, but then lick the boots of the AI gods because we like AI. stop licking boots just because you think yours taste's better.","levelheaded conversation maybe   i'm not quite sure what happened here, i think i left this not even lukewarm comment on someone's post and they blocked me. can we look at this objectively without getting mad that someone doesn't think like we do, all i'm saying is we are actively working against our morals simply because we like something and we don't want it ""taken away"". lmao just checked my email, yeah the dude replied and then blocked me, classic move. i'm not in opposition of ai, you are simply trading one boot for another is all i'm saying. like truly no one likes or thinks apple, or microsoft, or amazon should have a right to our data, but using data to create ai models makes sense and is fair? sure it's necessary to create these models, but if you are using content, created by another person, they should be compensated, this isn't a crazy mathematical equation. stop thinking in terms of ""oh no, if we go down this path, i might not be able to use ai"" because i don't believe that, getting more people on board and ok with the use of ai is only a net positive, and this hive mind, lock in step, way of thinking is not doing it. not being able to have a conversation, without getting defensive, is not doing it. i know that training is not theft u/exposing_hate, the taking of the images to train is where the potential theft lies, not the process, not the generation of images, literally scrubbing the internet for images that people have taken or made themselves and using that data to train a model. my original comment is below, if you can be civil and open i have no problem taking this conversation further, if not i just won't reply to you.

1g6fmw0,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Meta announces partnership with Blumhouse to test MovieGen Meta has announced a [partnership]( with Blumhouse Productions, known for producing horror movies like Get Out, Happy Death Day and the Insidious film series, where Blumhouse have selected filmmakers to test out Meta's video diffusion model, MovieGen. This seems to be similar to what OpenAI have done with Sora by allowing filmmakers to test out their video diffusion model.

Here is what Jason Blum, the founder of Blumhouse, has said about this partnership:

>Artists are and forever will be the lifeblood of our industry. Innovation and tools that can help those artists better tell their stories is something we are always keen to explore, and we welcomed the chance for some of them to test this cutting-edge technology and give their notes on its pros and cons while it’s still in development. These are going to be powerful tools for directors, and it’s important to engage the creative industry in their development to make sure they’re best suited for the job.

The selected filmmakers that Blumhouse have chosen to experiment with MovieGen are:

* Aneesh Chagnaty, who made the Screenlife movie Searching (one of my top-rated movies).
* The Spurlock Sisters who are Blumhouse's first annual Screamwriting Fellowship.
* Casey Affleck who made the limited release movie Light of my Life released in 2019.

Aneesh Chagnaty's short film has already been released and can be viewed on Meta's MovieGen page (I've taken a brief glance at it and IMO it reminds me of his Google Glass short film, Seeds that he made in 2014).

Of course, there are a lot of antis on X (formerly known as Twitter) that are very unhappy about this and are writing all kinds of tweets condemning this decision. Here are a few notable ones:

1hirch1,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"A Rant about Antis, Ableism, Gatekeeping and Elitism. It’s beyond frustrating to see the level of influence these Antis, people who seem to hate AI with every fiber of their being, have in the public conversation around this technology but a fuck ton and majority of these people don’t even consume, usually these are people who pirate far more than they buy, don’t create anything of value, and don’t contribute meaningfully to the industries they claim to “protect.” Many of them are unemployed or completely disconnected from the professional sectors they criticize. I mean like, let’s talk about the so-called “artists” who are leading the charge. A significant number of them can’t actually draw or create anything of notable quality. They’re people who picked up a hobby, never developed it beyond a surface level, and now feel threatened by AI tools because those tools are empowering others to outpace them. Then there’s their support network: friends and online mutuals who also lack any real artistic ability but want to feel like part of a righteous movement. They’re not stakeholders but spectators who shout from the sidelines without understanding the game. But here’s where it gets ironic and infuriating: companies, policymakers, and even tech developers are catering to these voices. Why? Why are we giving so much weight to people who have no skin in the game, no understanding of how these technologies work, and no constructive ideas for moving forward? These Antis aren’t the customers. They’re not the innovators. They’re not the creators driving industries forward.

Look, AI absolutely needs thoughtful regulation. Nobody is arguing against that. We need policies that prevent monopolization, mitigate harm, and ensure AI doesn’t steamroll entire job markets overnight. That’s common sense. But we need to approach this issue with nuance, engaging the people who are actually impacted, workers, business leaders, skilled artists, and active consumers, not just whoever screams the loudest online. AI isn’t the death of creativity. It’s a tool, like the printing press or Photoshop before it. The problem isn’t the tool itself but how it’s used. Instead of having productive conversations about things like copyright protections, ethical usage, or fair compensation for artists whose work might inform AI models, the debate has been hijacked by people shouting “AI bad” without offering a single constructive solution. Let’s not ignore the incredible potential of AI to help people in ways we never imagined.   
  
Let’s call this what it is: ableism, gatekeeping, and elitism by people who aren’t even elite in the areas they’re defending. Take Randy Travis, for example. After a stroke left him unable to sing, AI technology allowed him to continue making music by recreating his voice. This isn’t just a tool for convenience; it’s a tool for enabling people to keep creating and contributing, even in the face of immense challenges. Stories like this highlight why AI is worth embracing and why the conversation needs to be about smart usage, not blind rejection. Meanwhile, these tools are helping countless people. Small business owners are automating tasks they couldn’t otherwise afford to outsource. Aspiring creators are experimenting with art and writing in ways they never thought possible. Disabled individuals are using AI to bridge gaps in accessibility. Are we seriously going to ignore all of that because a group of people who don’t even use these tools. and couldn’t make good use of them if they tried, are making noise? At the end of the day, progress doesn’t wait for permission. AI is here, and it’s not going anywhere. We can either regulate it smartly and shape its integration into society in a way that benefits everyone, or we can let these misguided Antis derail the conversation entirely, leaving us with poor policy and missed opportunities.

1ctbr8x,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"As an NSFW creator with good income, some thoughts on AI porn My background is as a traditional artist but mostly as a 3D Artist.  
  
I studied in the most important academy in Milan and worked on TV productions and TV series for the most important online streaming platforms.  
  
In my spare time I am a video game modder and in the last 6 months I became a Hentai creator through the use of Stable Diffusion which is helping me to round up my income as a 3D freelancer.  
  
Knowing closely the world of 3D and the world of traditional drawing I want to formulate a thought because every now and then I get hating that makes me question human intelligence.

Let's start right away by saying that the “is it or isn't it art” discourse does not interest me in the slightest, it is a dilemma as old as the world and I want to stay away from it, in my socials there is no reference to art and I do not call myself an artist.

100% of the NSFW community here on Reddit willingly accepts 3D porn.

Since this is my field I want to explore the topic further.

Almost all 3d porn, not to say all of it, consists of models made by other artists, extrapolated from video games and other media, pre-rigged by others and used for animations of dubious quality that in the vast majority of cases are so low effort that the author doesn't even deign to spend a few hours setting up blend shapes to help the model not bend unnaturally.

I say this as a competent 3D Artist, it is GARBAGE that uses for its near totality the work of others and not even well.

With the 3D talk settled, let's move on to traditional 2D drawing.

I received a comment on Twitter recently from the usual 2D artist advising me to “get the fuck out of the way” until I was able to pick up a pen.

The moment I sent him my concepts made during the academic journey, he blocked me.

I then took a look at his socials.

The guy, with dubious technical skills in drawing, for a colored image, asks the modest sum of $70....

And one does not know exactly for what reasoning, he feels the need to vomit on my work that has nothing to do with his and does not even have the same goals.

To be clear, what do I do as an NSFW creator?

I make weekly sets of about 100 images on different characters that my subscribers happily masturbate to and that a traditional artist obviously cannot do due to time constraints.

We don't play the same game, we don't do the same thing, instead of spitting on other people's work go support the 2D artists you like so much.

Is my work low effort? No, absolutely not.

You don't know how many times I am asked how I make such beautiful feet and hands, if I use any particular Lora or model but no one is satisfied with the answer.

I draw by hand with my graphics tablet and then blend it all through inpaint, there's no secret trick.

How do I do such complex poses? I am a 3D Artist, I create my own Depth Maps with my own made and rigged models and through Control Net I get the poses I want.

My work requires more effort, dedication and time than all these invertebrates hating on AI without the ability to formulate coherent thought.

A message to these individuals, you are a flock of sheep without talent.

And to the community moderators who ban content made in part or in whole through AI-based tools, which are now almost all giving voice to this minority of invertebrates, you suck just as much as these individuals and limit human expression in a dangerous way.

i make weekly sets of about 100 images on different characters that my subscribers happily masturbate to and that a traditional artist obviously cannot do due to time constraints.

we don't play the same game, we don't do the same thing, instead of spitting on other people's work go support the 2d artists you like so much.

is my work low effort? no, absolutely not.

you don't know how many times i am asked how i make such beautiful feet and hands, if i use any particular lora or model but no one is satisfied with the answer.

i draw by hand with my graphics tablet and then blend it all through inpaint, there's no secret trick.

how do i do such complex poses? i am a 3d artist, i create my own depth maps with my own made and rigged models and through control net i get the poses i want.

my work requires more effort, dedication and time than all these invertebrates hating on ai without the ability to formulate coherent thought.

a message to these individuals, you are a flock of sheep without talent.

and to the community moderators who ban content made in part or in whole through ai-based tools, which are now almost all giving voice to this minority of invertebrates, you suck just as much as these individuals and limit human expression in a dangerous way.

sorry if i made this post so long but i've been mulling over these concepts for a while and i wanted to share them with you.

1fy289u,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"AI is not really as good as you guys are gassing it up to be. yes even today. i am pro ai but holy shit its absolute trash. So, i have seen many people advocating about ai tools assisting in creative jobs and helping easy access to high quality production. but i have tried several times and am having difficulty in that regard.

so, what i am going to ask is best suited for this subreddit because

1. as it seems this subreddit has a higher chance of getting a better answer than a general purpose subreddit.
2. i have many reservations and skepticism about capabilities of ai based on my personal experience and data available online.

and i am going to keep my language pretty casual. i don't care if anyone finds it rude. i just want to get my point across.

first issue,  
--yes ai does look pretty good at first glance. a still image many times is even capable of fooling people's eyes. but how is it going to help me?? it does not know context, nuance, details and continuity etc at all. i have been looking for months and i have not found a single reliable tool that can help me maintain any level of consistency. if i want a character to show a certain complex emotion, it can't do that. if i want it to show conflicting facial expressions, it can't do that either. the only thing it does is make it look realistic. its fucking useless.  
you can call me hater for breaking it to you, but i have not seen a single ai user that is capable of recognizing these issues. even if someone does, they turn out to be pretending to know about these. everything falls apart when i go into any detailed discussion and they just start calling me anti or something. i am just trying to discuss and fucking learn about something i am passionate about.

--this issue relates to concept art. this is so infuriating. whenever i generate a base for a character to make changes on it later. it is impossible. and let me tell you, it is fucking impossible to get any kind of details right in the character i generate. if i want to change very specific parts of a character, like a belt, hairstyle, or very specific eyes, it completely falls apart. it wastes so much of my fucking time whenever i have to fix every single thing by my own hands. not to mention how time consuming it becomes due to this. even more so when i have to make changes on a colored piece. and when i make any changes on the character, like if i give a character a bag, and try to run it through the software gain to make the artstyle consistent, it fucking destroys it.  
another issue crops up when i want the model to generate character props from a very specific time period. it cannot fucking do that either. it has no knowledge about time periods.  
all of you guys here pretend like ""what a good job ai as done"". ngl lie, i think haters have very big and valid point in calling you guys lazy when you can't even be bothered to fix errors and inconsistencies in the images.

--this issue is very specific to llms. i have experimented with it the most and it has the shittiest results. when i write something, i structure my paragraphs and chapters in order to set up specific plots, situations, and set up moods. i tried getting chatgpt to help me check for grammar and continuity errors. but no. it does not do that. it completely dumbs down the plotline into a summary that destroys all the anticipation and build up in the text to the point it makes it unbearable to read. do it over multiple chapters and it destroys all the continuity and consistency in writing style. it is half decent and editing a single chapter on its own if you edit with it, but use it for multiple chapters and say good bye to all the readers.  
ai is so bad at assisting that instead of helping speed up my process, it takes up even more time to fix up all the places it fucks up.  
it is so fucking bad that it is faster to do it by myself all alone. i don't care how good, realistic or detailed it looks, the most valued thing in creative field is details, consistency, nuance and complexity. and having any kind of assistance from ai destroys all of those.

i have been spending months in ai subreddits, keeping up with all the latest news and techniques hoping that maybe after a month, then a few months then maybe after a year i am going to be able to produce something decent with it. but all i have ever seen are all of you guys circle jerking each other on how good ai looks.

holy shit you guys are so shallow that only thing you care about is how good ai looks instead of the quality of the produced media. what the fuck am i supposed to do with a pretty picture when it fails to represent anything i want to illustrate??

i have tried over and over and over again to have any semblance of a decent productive conversation with you guys, but god-forbid if my words forced you to use your brain beyond ""pretty picture"".

you guys produce levels of incompetence i never thought were humanely possible.

more than trying to use your own tools to build up your workflows and communities, i have seen more scams trying to poke the hornet's nest on the other side to piss them off then you pat you on your back as if you have done something admirable by making an angry person angry.

you guys look so fucking desperate trying to weasel your ways into communities you don't belong despite having flourishing communities yourself, it makes me embarrassed to admit that i use ai in front of anyone.

NOW! WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN YOUR DEFENCE??  
I do not fuking care about anti ai or pro ai. i just like technology. and this is the biggest hot garbahe i have seen in my lifetime.

i want to fucking know how is artificial intelligence is the future in your delusional eyes when the only thing it has improved itself in is just superficial looks and has failed to evolve any kind of meaningful utility and accuracy in its generation??

i did not care before. but honestly, every day i get more convinced that maybe the ""antis"" are right about you guys being the biggest hypocrites and nothing burger who only like hating on them because you don't have the ability to improve yourself in any meaningful way.

1cawizz,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Art as a sport. (is AI ""cheating"") A lot of people here wonder why many artists are so opposed to AI. I typically lurk on Reddit, and this isn't the typical type of post here but I haven't seen this idea expressed elsewhere so I want to share it.

There are many arguments artists have but they are all very bad, AI doesn't steal and doesn't stop people from making art themselves. So why are artists against AI? Yes, people can be wrong, but the idea AI ""steals"" isn't popular for no reason. Maybe its their jobs? But artists are typically not receptive to UBI or a different economic system and many don't make any money from their art at all.

So why?

Because AI art is ""cheating"" at art. 

-----


When you make art, you put in a lot of time and effort, both to get good at the type of art (and art in general) and also to make that specific art piece. 

Imagine someone who puts in hundreds of hours into making song, a video or anything else, and then they see something similar that took way less time and effort is way more popular. 

They will probably be pretty resentful, feel they have been slighted by the world and be angry at not just whoever made the thing but anyone who likes it. 

Think of how many people hate ""low effort"" content on Youtube or despise pop music. Why? Because ""why is that getting attention when this other thing is so much better"" of course the thing is often better for the audience (people like pop music!) but because the less popular thing took more effort it is automatically seen as better, even in casual conversation people will use ""low effort"" as a synonym for ""bad."" What could be more low effort than typing some text into a box?

---------------


An even better example is sport, imagine you are an Olympic athlete competing in a race, now imagine you know many of your opponents will be in a car. You will be mad at them. You will be shocked that this is allowed. You will hate anyone who supports them. You will be incredibly demotivated to race, or to train the sport at all. You certainly wont want to use a car yourself.

This is why many artists act like AI art existing stops them from making art, it obviously doesn't but like the athlete, there doesn't seem to be a point in running against cars.

------------

This explains even more things. Why are many artists often so protective of the word ""artist"" and ""art"", why do they refuse to call AI art ""art"" and instead call it AI images or similar things. 

Because being an artist is very important to their identity and people driving cars aren't Olympic athletes, aren't runners, don't ""deserve"" to be called that. If everyone can make ""art"" then no one can uniquely be called an ""artist."" This threatens their identity, the same way many famous artists who grow old and get worse at art become neurotic or pretend as if they haven't. 

------

Why do artists act like it is AI creator's fault or AI user's fault for them falsely accusing hand made artists of using AI? Imagine someone cheats in a sport, and after this everyone has to go through far more extensive measures to confirm they aren't cheating and many more people are falsely accused of cheating. Most people will blame the cheater.

---------

This, I believe, is where the ""stealing"" claims come from too, yes there is a lot of misinformation but why did it spread? Its convenient, sure, but also:

If someone cheats at a sport, and wins an event or becomes a champion or anything else, they can be said to have ""stolen"" it from whoever would have done so if they weren't cheating. Any attention given to AI art is ""stolen"" from ""real"" art. Any money not given to an artist because the buyer used AI instead is ""stolen"" from the artist.

------

This is not to say any of this is good or the ""right"" way to think about this. Of course its not, art has many purposes. Most obviously its to be used in something and contribute to whatever that thing is for the value of whoever it is for. Another is enjoying making it, unaffected by anyone else. 

Hopefully though this can help some people realise why artists often seem to act so irrational in response to AI. I'm sure you can think of many other examples that make a lot more sense when thought through this perspective.

---


One interesting thing, is that there are obviously other reasons people don't like AI but most of these aren't lasting. If someone associates AI art with mutilated hands, crypto or spam then that association won't last forever. This however might.

1cv1c48,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Comparison to when CAD became a thing I am a mechanical designer. I began on a drafting table back in the early 1980s. I worked in what we called 'bull pens', big rooms of draftsmen, all 'ass and elbows'. Drinking coffee, smoking, and drawing all day, a phone at either end of the room. Often my jobs were even as simple as just lettering parts lists on drawings. I remember that it was 40 hours billing for a D sized drawing, no matter what was on it. 

It took a pyramid of an engineer or two, some designers under them, and dozens of draftsmen to do a drawing. Oh, and a Checker.

Then CAD (AutoCAD to be precise) came along and what happened is that the expectation became that that designers and engineers would do their own drafting. Because of the nature of working with CAD, when you worked out the design, you pretty much had the drafting done too. So just plain old draftsmen disappeared, you really had to be able to do design too. 

I don't know what happened when the 30 draftsmen weren't being hired anymore, I assume a lot of them became designers, or quit the industry for other jobs. 

Timetables collapsed too. Instead of weeks for a drawing, it became days. People either loved it or hated it. Or both. At first, no one trusted the CAD files and we still printed everything out and considered the print the 'real' work. There was this stink eye about it all. And it didn't help that suddenly we had these 'cad jockeys' that would show up, fresh from ITT or some place, that knew how to work AutoCAD, but knew jack about making a good drawing.

Anyways. In time, industry changed and got used it and was better for it. And I predict the same thing will happen with AI art. That consolidation will happen. You want to create a comic book, an illustrated novel, a movie, animation, whatever, now the 'engineer' (person with the Big Idea) will/can do it all.

But I wonder how this argument works.

Just want to clarify, I'm a pretty big fan of AI and the technology and I'd love seeing it get more accepted in the future.

But I'm kind of wondering if this argument will keep working.  
A person who is opposed to the technology could possibly argue that ""It's not conscious, sentient and self-thinking, therefor it cannot get inspired"".

I've heard the term ""data laundering"" or ""data white washing"" a few times as well.

And it has got me thinking, how do you defend it against such arguments?

I've seen a bunch of communities have pretty much started banning AI generated images because ""It takes advantage of artists"".

Which... I don't exactly see the point? I'm a 3D artist myself, but I don't really feel like I'm being taken advantage of?

Theoretically, a person with malicious intend could take every image I have ever created for example, run it through a training process, and recreate the style and everything and say ""My AI got inspired by your work"".

I personally wouldn't really have a big issue with this myself if it doesn't do any harm in the end, but I could see why it might bother others.

But is that a valid reason to ban it? Because that honestly doesn't seem like the fault of AI, but rather that of the person with malicious intend.

1d8etdq,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"I never understood how artists might feel being ""replaced"" by AI, so why don't I try applying a similar scenario to something I can understand? I should preface this by saying that the conclusion I reached in coming up with this analogy didn't change my opinion at all, so this exercise accomplished basically nothing for me lol. Feel free to let me know if I failed to note anything important or let me know what I might have been wrong about.  
  
I've been a fan of generative AI since I first started playing with Dall E Mini in senior year high school. Of course back then everyone was just making funny images to show their buddies, but It was really fun. Over the next couple years, as it advanced further, I started to see images that genuinely impressed me. I've never been a person with a particular passion for art, but it was more the idea that impressive art could be made artificially that was very intriguing to me. That's why it's very dissatisfying to me to see the heavy discourse online about this subject, and the often uneducated arguments being thrown around on social media and such. Of course I'm aware that the advancement of GAI raises important concerns that need to be discussed, but its still aggravating to me. After all, I'm still just having fun lol.   
  
Many artists feel that they are ""stolen"" from when images are scraped from publicly accessible sources on the internet for training. Despite the fact that their images are likely a tiny drop in the bucket of any given model's learning (if they're even included in training at all), this concern seems to be held by very many artists. I never understood that perspective personally, but I'm not an artist so it may not be fair for me judge their feelings. So I thought that I should try to come up with an analogy that might help me gain some perspective on how they might feel.

I really only have a couple meaningful creative outlets, but I think the most applicable for this purpose would be Minecraft building. I have been building in Minecraft for a few years now, and I like to think I've gotten pretty good at it. I think most would agree that Minecraft building is a valid creative process, at least for the purpose of this analogy.

Before I come up with the rules of this hypothetical, it is worth noting that this hypothetical is directed at the artists that aren't using art for income, and just object to AI art because its somehow evil to them. This has nothing to do with the concerns over money, that's an entirely seperate discussion.

So now let's say that there were an AI, that was trained to create a Minecraft build in the game based on a prompt written by the player. Also, this AI is trained entirely on Minecraft buildings that are posted publicly by players who were unaware that it could be used for this purpose. Given this rule, I'd be placing myself in a similar position as the artists who are concerned about their images being used, as its possible mine could be used for training without my knowledge. With these rules in place, I think we have a hypothetical that is very realistic, and very similar to the current discord related to art and GAI.  
  
Now given the rules in this hypothetical scenario, what would my opinion of this AI be? After all it ""stole"" my creative work, and is enabling players with lesser skill to spawn buildings that sometimes look better than mine just by typing a few words! How can I accept this affront to humanity!? ITS UTTERLY OFFENSIVE! IT HAS NO SOUL!

Yeah I'm just kidding, I really wouldn't care. I think that's pretty obvious from how I started this post.   
  
I wouldn't be offended by an algorithm learning how to create buildings based on publicly available images of the buildings. After all that's how most players learn! Nearly every player I know has at one point or another straight up copied a building they've seen online while they were still novice. Its the starting point for growth in building. For all I know players have been doing that for my builds already, and I don't mind that prospect at all. And in art the same applies: Attempting to recreate art that you see is a helpful exercise in improving your art in the early stages. And that's never been considered wrong by anybody as long as you aren't specifically claiming that its your own original work. If anything this could be considered more blatant copying than anything that a generative text to image AI does. Not to mention the AI generated structures could be used as a learning tool for new players as well.  
  
I wouldn't be bothered by perceived worse builders being able to make better buildings through prompting. At the end of the day a nice build is a nice build and I don't care if it's made ""the easy way"". I may even see the generated buildings and take inspiration from them. I seriously don't see how these hypothetical other players' use of this AI should have anything to do with me just because the AI may or may not have learned from what I shared with the world. I made it publicly available and that means anyone can use it for anything that they want (as long as its legal of course). Now if this other builder used the AI and falsely claimed that they built the result block by block, that would be malicious. To be fair though I don't think anyone's arguing that its right to misrepresent your work like that anyway.

So in the end I kind of wound up with the exact same stance, albeit with a little bit more basis for thinking these artists are being unreasonable since I have a bit more perspective using this analogy. Did I miss any of the prominent arguments used by anti-AI people(of course excluding any of the money discussion because Minecraft EULA means this analogy doesn't apply for that)? Does this analogy work or is it flawed?","i never understood how artists might feel being  replaced"" by ai, so why don't i try applying a similar scenario to something i can understand? i should preface this by saying that the conclusion i reached in coming up with this analogy didn't change my opinion at all, so this exercise accomplished basically nothing for me lol. feel free to let me know if i failed to note anything important or let me know what i might have been wrong about.

1df3obx,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Poisoning Adobe Datasets I'm hearing talks of anti AI people trying to get Nightshaded images uploaded to their Adobe clouds to poison the Adobe system because Adobe apparently trains on anything uploaded. I'm thinking this will not work for a few reasons. 

1. Nightshade is only as good as its update. As AI generators get smarter, they'll be able to bypass Nightshade and Glaze. I would think that to get the highest protection, anyone using these programs will have to keep up with the updates and make sure their images are protected with the lastest version-assuming that Nightshade continues to evolve with the AI detectors.

2. The creators of Nightshade claim that Nightshade's goal is [NOT to break models]( but to increase the cost of training on unlicensed data. Nightshade also works to deter model trainers who disregard copyrights or opt outs.

3. Maliciously attempting to poison datasets just to do so would be a waste of time. As AI systems improve, they'll likely learn to bypass Nightshade and Glazed images.

Each defendant will have 10 minutes to argue the issues most significant to it. Plaintiffs will have 40 minutes in total to argue the issues most significant to them. 

Tentative Rulings 

Plaintiffs should have sought leave before adding additional named plaintiffs and the Unjust Enrichment claim. However, had they asked, leave would have been freely given. Therefore, following the final order on the pending motions, I am inclined to allow plaintiffs to file a Second Amended Complaint adding the new plaintiffs. With respect to the new Unjust Enrichment claims – as alleged in the First Amended Complaint based on use of plaintiffs’ “works” – leave to amend would be DENIED as futile, because those claims are preempted by the Copyright Act. Plaintiffs will be allowed one final attempt to allege non-preempted Unjust Enrichment claims against specific defendants. An amended Unjust Enrichment claim may be included in the Second Amended Complaint. 

I am inclined to DENY all motions to dismiss the direct and induced infringement claims under the Copyright Act. Beyond the Training Images theory (that suffices for direct infringement as to Stability, Runway, and Midjourney), plaintiffs have plausibly alleged facts to suggest compress copies, or effective compressed copies albeit stored as mathematical information, of their works are contained in the versions of Stable Diffusion identified. At this juncture, plaintiffs should be allowed to proceed with discovery. The facts regarding how the diffusion models operate, or are operated by the defendants, should be tested at summary judgment against various direct and induced infringement theories and precedent under the Copyright Act.

I am inclined to GRANT the motions to dismiss all DMCA claims. Under (a), the license disclosures were not made “in connection with” plaintiffs’ works.

I am inclined to DENY Midjourney’s motion to dismiss the false endorsement and trade dress claims. 

I am inclined to GRANT DeviantArt’s motion to dismiss the contract claim for express breach and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, consistent with my analysis from the October 2023 Order. Dated: May 7, 2024","procedures and tentative rulings for may 8  2024 hearing to focus the parties’ arguments for tomorrow’s hearing, below are tentative rulings on the claims in dispute. each defendant will have 10 minutes to argue the issues most significant to it. plaintiffs will have 40 minutes in total to argue the issues most significant to them. 

tentative rulings 

plaintiffs should have sought leave before adding additional named plaintiffs and the unjust enrichment claim. however, had they asked, leave would have been freely given. therefore, following the final order on the pending motions, i am inclined to allow plaintiffs to file a second amended complaint adding the new plaintiffs. with respect to the new unjust enrichment claims – as alleged in the first amended complaint based on use of plaintiffs’ “works” – leave to amend would be denied as futile, because those claims are preempted by the copyright act. plaintiffs will be allowed one final attempt to allege non-preempted unjust enrichment claims against specific defendants. an amended unjust enrichment claim may be included in the second amended complaint. 

i am inclined to deny all motions to dismiss the direct and induced infringement claims under the copyright act. beyond the training images theory (that suffices for direct infringement as to stability, runway, and midjourney), plaintiffs have plausibly alleged facts to suggest compress copies, or effective compressed copies albeit stored as mathematical information, of their works are contained in the versions of stable diffusion identified. at this juncture, plaintiffs should be allowed to proceed with discovery. the facts regarding how the diffusion models operate, or are operated by the defendants, should be tested at summary judgment against various direct and induced infringement theories and precedent under the copyright act.

i am inclined to grant the motions to dismiss all dmca claims. under (a), the license disclosures were not made “in connection with” plaintiffs’ works. under (b), the court is inclined to follow the decision in doe 1 v. github, inc., no. 22-cv-06823-jst, 2024 wl 235217, at \*8 (n.d. cal. jan. 22, 2024), regarding the identicality requirement.

1amsnnf,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Why I believe AI art is not a threat to food/product photographers I’m not a legal expert, but I learned something interesting during a digital photography course. When it comes to advertising, there are rules about using images of food. While you can create artificial ice cubes for a Coca-Cola photo, the actual soda in the picture must be genuine. Similarly, if you’re selling a burger, you can’t just create a fictional image and call it a day. The product you’re advertising must be accurately represented in the photograph according to the law. 

My teacher was a food photographer. He said that they would use mashed potatoes for ice cream in order to set the lighting up. And then when it came time for the real ice cream photo, they would pull it out of the freezer and quickly take the photo. That way, the ice cream would be represented ethically without melting under the lights.

Midjourney's output of food photography in the right hands is phenomenal and pretty much photo realistic. But that doesn't mean it can be applied to everything, replacing photographers. We still need talented food photographers and product photographers. And will probably need them for the foreseeable future.

Plus if I know that a photograph is real, such as it was taken with a real captures am incredible moment with a landscape or an animal, I'm gonna have a greater appreciation for it. Because I know it really happened which makes it more valuable to me. But if I needed an owl for a Halloween poster, I'd probably use MJ for it. And that doesn't take anything away from a real photographer. Because I wouldn't have hired that photographer anyway. I probably would just change the concept.

Also, you can't midjourney your way through a real wedding either. Still need wedding photographers. Same with sports photography etc

All this to say there is room for AI art to live together with traditional art in a way where everyone benefits.","why i believe ai art is not a threat to food/product photographers i m not a legal expert, but i learned something interesting during a digital photography course. when it comes to advertising, there are rules about using images of food. while you can create artificial ice cubes for a coca-cola photo, the actual soda in the picture must be genuine. similarly, if you’re selling a burger, you can’t just create a fictional image and call it a day. the product you’re advertising must be accurately represented in the photograph according to the law.

I source and let others know when I’m using AI, and use it as tool to help my creativity.

My problem relies in the authenticity and ethics of AI. Particularly when others use AI as deception like selling products using AI generated images that don’t look anything like the actual product. Or artists claiming and selling AI art that they try to pass as traditional art. 

I have a real admiration for artwork, and it relies on the artist, their process and inspiration for the piece.

It’s all feels soulless after a while, just not interesting and lacks creativity. 

I’m not opposed to AI, but I believe it could be used much differently and can be applied to enhance creativity. For example on film sets, these tools can help quickly visualize different scenes/wardrobes before recording to help with direction.

[Vent] We've all seen these ""AI made me depressed, my previous work felt worthless"", but what about the other way round? What about those who used AI and then had to stop? This is my story.

I quickly adapted to AI-generated images when creating my games, my creativity was at an all-time high, and there were almost no limits to what kind of story I can write. I could generate almost every background I imagined and its wobbliness added a charm to it which I loved. Additionally, my efficiency doubled or was even better. I could focus on characters and dialogue instead of drawing.

Some time ago, games utilizing AI tech are no longer allowed on Steam. Why? Because of legal uncertainties. I understand Valve's point, this is nothing against the company policy. The issue is, that models were trained on copyrighted materials, and until there are court rulings or legislative changes nobody can be sure if using them commercially is allowed, so Steam decided to play it safe for now as they are responsible for content they distribute. And I admit, at the beginning, I was also hesitant but then more and more people used Stable Diffusion in commercial products so I thought it was OK.

So, not only do I feel like I wasted time making another interesting game with colorful scenery and characters, I have to go back to the way I made games before that, over half a year ago. Which is not only tiresome, the end result is far from what I'd like it to be. I'm not an artist, just a dude who knows how to hold a pencil and wants to make stuff. Furthermore, after weighing all pros and cons I decided I can't release that game for free as it was so good it would only raise expectations for my other paid games.

And I'll tell you, it all made me very, very sad. Most of my ideas are put on a shelf, as I can't afford to hire artists, and nor can I draw background art myself at the quality and time I'd like.

As for character sprites, the AI looked so beautiful! Just perfect. I only had to manually fix minor imperfections and added my own flair to it. I was using anime style, but it doesn't matter anymore.

To make things clear - I didn't just generate an image and call it quits, I've generated hundreds of images, with inpainting, img2img to get that one, perfect image I had in mind. I had the most fun photobashing and manually drawing to match character designs across various illustrations.

I kinda feel like I was rugpulled and having withdrawal syndrome.

I don't want this post to be some kind of self-promotion so no links. Just look up my username (and make sure you have the NSFW filter disabled on Steam ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) if you want to see how I was using this tech.

I had someone claim that the melody was ""ripped off"" because a machine made it and I was just like, ""It was built around the rhythm of my lyrics AND I went through a hundred iterations to select a melody."" To me, if that's not 100% songwriting, it's more than 50% and there's no human being cheated out of the rest. Melodies in particular follow rigid rules and are algorithmically producible.

And, sure, I didn't record the instruments but my musician uncle uses synthesizer fake instruments the same way. I seriously doubt the actual instrument sounds on Suno are anything BUT a properly licensed synthesizer library.

I imagine the stock singers also agreed to have their voices cloned but, like I say, I replace the stock vocals ANYWAY.

It's frustrating to write 1800 words of lyrics with atypical rhythms that draw on personal experiences, mull through a hundred possible melodies with adjusted prompts every time, use stock synthesizer sounds, do EDITING including rearranging and removing/adding sections and be told ""because AI"" I'm not doing anything.

I feel like the ONLY THING I'm getting from AI here is ease.

And people act weird when I say that copyright doesn't cover style, personality rights at the state level might if it's identifiable, and sweat of the brow matters in the U.S. but not most countries. But if you reversed those things, Disney could go after Cuphead and Bendy for the artstyle, Tom Scioli and Steve Rude for drawing like 60s Jack Kirby.

I think the standards I see proposed (which a lot of people don't even seem to realize ARE changes) would be more likely to lead to Disney wrecking every indie cartoonist and WB wrecking every indie singer than actually stopping AI, which COULD probably just pay Disney and Sony and WB for a filter model that makes sure results don't match an existing style by comparing.","songwriting and suno i did some suno stuff recently  wrote lyrics from scratch with an unusual rhythm. removed and replaced suno's stock vocals.

1gfdeag,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Why the Debate Over AI Art Feels Misplaced: Let’s Focus on the Real Issue I’ve noticed a trend lately where people who use AI art are being targeted, while the companies creating these tools face way less criticism. Yes, concerns around AI, copyright, and fair use are totally valid—artists deserve recognition and fair compensation. But going after individual creators using AI tools feels both unfair and a bit like missing the point.

Art has always evolved through shared influence. Painters, writers, musicians—they all build on past work. While AI accelerates this process, it’s still just a tool, like digital art programs or photography, that creators use to explore new ideas. Attacking users of AI overlooks this tradition and instead alienates people who are trying to create within the rules given.

If we’re genuinely concerned about the ethics of AI, the focus should be on the companies profiting from it. They control the datasets, the policies, and ultimately, how the tech operates. It’s these companies that need to be held accountable for responsible AI practices, ethical sourcing, and compensation systems that respect original artists.

So instead of going after individuals using AI, let’s push for clear guidelines, copyright protections, and ethical standards from those who hold the real power in this space. Let’s work together to make AI art fair, without attacking creators for exploring a new medium.","why the debate over ai art feels misplaced: let s focus on the real issue i’ve noticed a trend lately where people who use ai art are being targeted, while the companies creating these tools face way less criticism. yes, concerns around ai, copyright, and fair use are totally valid—artists deserve recognition and fair compensation. but going after individual creators using ai tools feels both unfair and a bit like missing the point.

1dph4ze,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Pro-AI person venting - I am not trying to debate but just outlaying my thoughts I feel like the AI discourse is a showcase of mostly two big points:

1. The people of the Internet (all forms: from the common individual to the degenerate lurkers) have been conditioned to respect corporations and 'online people' at face value - regardless as to the connection from being close friends to just being a parasocial viewer - as a result of the mostly money-driven appealing done by these lobbyists and groups successfully working to make the 'audience' or 'viewer base' feel personally responsible for their burdens. This can be applied as ""I cannot work a job because I don't want to work a job, I want the system to be better"" to ""I'm successful but I feel this will harm my success"", but many people don't seem to care about the difference and instead lobby for everyone under the guise of ""protecting interests"" or ""protecting competency"", when really everyone's goals and reasonings need to followed more with nuance, not with black and white thinking.

2. It has become common for the workers to now blame the tools and not the system, resulting in the surge of both in-fighting and the practices of gatekeeping being reintroduced even in the most artzy or far-left of beliefs, solely to prevent change to occur to make those who would be benefited from a better economy (or the removal of it in something like Communism or Anarchism in practice). In essence, many leftests have shown that they are not progress-driven, but moderately left.

  
This are two bold statements I present because of my experience with discussing this topic over the last couple of years. From the beginning around 2022, I've always been Pro-AI. Even now, I am pro-AI. I have several biases which result in this being the case, or at least I would think so.... but with the explosion in the discourse, it seems even what I thought made it clear with bias isn't accurate or common with my peers. Here's what my biases were, and still are:

* I am a currently closeted anarchist - I'm currently questioning my own personal stance on subjects like government where I'm more aligned to being more socialist (especially in Communist ideals), but have been much aligned to Individualist Anarchism for many years socially, as I currently explore 'egoism' philosophy in tandem.
* I have been online for about a decade as a kid (I remember the 2010 YouTube layout with those numbered badges, or Roblox back when it's logo was an R and you could play as a guest without an account), and during this time I had been exposed heavily to many subcultures that rely on unauthorized reuse to make a new ""product"", ""content"", or as I remembered it being mostly called, a fun video or image. Some examples would be YTP/YTPMV, Vaporwave, YTMND, ""compilation videos"" of sites like Vine or Instagram, and later on in my years I learned of older subcultures like the Demoscene or Cracktro groups which have both roots and practices in piracy.
* I am a pirater. I have no shame in admitting this, although I don't do this frequently either. Some of the programs I have pirated are Sony Vegas and FL Studio, as up until recently, I had no way to pay online properly. I didn't have any cards, and I didn't want to ask my family to buy some expensive digital program when I don't even know if I would get used to it's features.
* I produce... a lot, but mostly deal with music. I love sampling, and resampling. I am heavily inspired by Hip Hop, House, Vaporwave (as mentioned previously) and Plunderphonics for the small handful here who know about what this term means ;)
* I am personally for the abolition, or at least retooling, of Copyright law as a whole. I think that, with what I've mentioned previously, there is art that flourishes when it doesn't try to hide it's influences or reuse from other producers. Copyright law, as it exists today, is used by corporations or people that represent one another to take down and bully other people for reuse of work through the legal system. It is rarely used to protect bootlegging and is instead used more to takedown ""ideas that are similar"" when a company wants to make a product that competes, but wants to ensure market dominance. My mind immediately remembers companies from both the past and present that have done this - Viacom, Nintendo, Take Two Interactive, RIAA, just to name the obvious few in my head.

I discovered this subreddit about 45 minutes ago but only explored maybe 5 minutes in total. Already, I saw several specific comparisons that ensure that I have found something of a calling card for a home to my thoughts.

* It is dangerous that we are trying to provide companies like the RIAA power to takedown AI tools (meanwhile those involved in the RIAA are also using AI tools, the ones supposadly taking jobs away want to take your right away while the rest yell at each other to stop using it)
* Technology fosters within a revolution, but rarely does it actually remove the previous tools use, it's just another tool with a different sound. AI is to the art world how Synthesizers were to the Orchestra, or how Videotape was to the Filmstrip.
* Just a few years ago, mainstream internet was making fun of NFT's because they were trying to make digital rights a thing through token ownership of a piece of 'digital property', where the userbase overinflated the value and caused a boom and bust. I'm personally not Pro-NFT in how many people viewed it, but understand that a minority have suggested the technology could be useful for cases like Digital Tickets as opposed to ""Digital Art Ownership"". People were making fun of even small artists who wanted to use NFT's because of the idea that ""you don't own the art since you can just copy it"". AI also just copy things off of its data, but all of a sudden many of these people now want to say that Artists need to have a right to own the art and control ""their property"".

And to add one point I didn't see, but that I think should be said: AI Is Fair Use in the United States. It is not ""stealing your art"" as how many say it does, it does take bits and pieces and makes something with those pieces like a puzzle. You cannot 'steal' art from bits, even if you reuse only one artist to make a new piece. Try telling every person who did fanart of some character ""that's so and so's character, you are violating the persons right by drawing them""!

My close friend is anti-AI, really anti-AI. They are a Marxist Communist, and an artist of their own. I love to debate with them and talk with the subject, although we debate differently and we have two different viewpoints. They have said when I bring this subject up that, all AI will do in our current society is be used to exploit the workers and take away jobs. They don't apply it entirely consistently, They are really only concerned with her labor being taken away as they want to draw for a living as its something they enjoy and do get money for doing. I, on the other hand with my work, do not like to make money off of it. For example, I use Bandcamp for my music, and I have it set where the fans can set their price. It's all zero dollars, instant download ready. I enjoy if I am able to get profit, but I don't want to lock my art to be ""pay to view"" when it should be ""donate if enjoyed, take and spread the word"". To add to this, they do see it as a tool for artists, but not something that should be used as its 'harmful' to artists. Last time I debated with them, they had pushed back on my belief and practice that I was going to start using AI tools despite its potentional harm as I believe not only does it benefit the artists more, but the issues it does have are systematic...

The reason the issue with labor exploitation exists is entirely a fault of capitalism, especially when money is more important than labor. Of course companies will exploit tools, especially something that automates like this, but that doesn't stop the art from flowing nor should it be looked at as harmful tools! Artists should, and need, to use these tools when it helps them with their work, or if they can do something more possible with AI-assisted tools. I've debated and found that they would be comfortable with AI use only when the system is different, but until then we shouldn't use these tools at all. I really don't agree with this, and as a result I've started to utilize AI tools properly in my work - not to be petty to them, but I personally want to use them and I want to make a statement. Luckily, I do have a small handful who are either AI-neutral, and even little who are AI-positive. Personally, if we want ""labor"" to actually be healed in the system, we need to CHANGE THE SYSTEM. Revolution needs to happen and this should be a good candidate for that change. Instead, people are more focused on eating each others tails, and sadly it's not only being encouraged but normalized.

I just read two stories which really did me in - one was that Toys R Us just made a advertisement that was entirely AI, and the other was that the RIAA is suing two AI companies for 'using their songs illegally'. I give people legs to stand on mentally, and there was this one comment highlighted in the Toys R Us article that pissed me off - it was a 'voice of the people' post about how ""we all were excited when Toys R Us came back from near-death, and now we all want Toys R Us to die! Shame on everyone involved!""... like damn, that's brutal! Toys R Us is very much not at the height of it's fame in money or success, and we want to just curb stomp small companies - and lets be honest, small groups of people, artists especially - who even dare touch AI because it 'harms the rest of us'. This is some crab mentality bullshit!

One last thing I'll mention is that, AI is such an opener for people who don't know the software or tools to be able to make something that will satisfy their needs quicker and sufficiently! I have autism, and I personally love to explore new software to make what I want, as that is my lifestyle and I find it fun. All of the people who are neurodivergent but have huge trouble with attention, like some with Autism and those with ADHD, now no longer need to make something with a program they find ""hard to use"", or pay someone money if they either don't have the funds or barely make it within their livelihoods. ND's aren't dumb, we often understand much more better that things are fickle and just the amount of nuance something has, so it's not like AI is a personal replacement, but just a way to get an idea quickly out. Sadly once again, we have both infighting and crab mentality from fellow autistics who fight for capitalism under the guise of ""protecting artists"" when its just them hearing talking points but never exploring where they truly came from, lobbiests who do not give two rat fucks about the art, and only care to manage success, fame, and most importantly, money. This whole debate is such a greed fest, and by this point, my novel I wrote had made me satisfied enough that I do hope that the fans and the haters have a field day within their personal urges as they look into inspiration, shitposting, or whatever satisfies them in this world of theirs! <3

Let's go back in time for a moment. To the days before digitization, machine learning, transformers and *Hail Corporate* indoctrination.

The journey of intellectual property started thousands of years ago with artisans and craftspeople designating the source of their works, like bricks, pottery, armor, livestock and [bread]( It was important to know where a thing came from and who made it. This practice served as a way to denote authorship and helped establish the foundation for modern IP law. The concept of trademarks in English common law is built upon the notion of marking or signing your work, helping protect brands and allowing customers to distinguish between different products.

The United States Constitution explicitly addresses the importance of IP protection:

&gt;""[Copyright Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause)"" Article I, Section 8, Clause 8, grants Congress the power ""*to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries*.""

Special interests have influenced IP law over the years, leading to a growing number of IP monopolies and the normalization of deceitful practices.

An IP monopoly occurs when a single entity has exclusive rights to a particular work or idea, preventing others from using or building upon it. This has a stifling effect on our collective creativity and limits the public's access to utilize works that would otherwise become available for everyone to enjoy and build upon. Disney is the prime example of a company that has manipulated and exploited of our current system, often using public domain works as the starting point for their creations and then making [derivative works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work) that are protected under IP law. This has led to confusion over what is public domain and what is owned by Disney, hindering expression and right to profit from one's own work.

Getty Images, on the other hand-- does not make anything, but they have been accused of copyfraud [countless times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images#Copyright_enforcement_and_controversy), falsely claiming ownership of public domain images and charging consumers for their use. In one instance, documentary photographer [Carol Highsmith](https://hyperallergic.com/314079/photographer-files-1-billion-suit-against-getty-for-licensing-her-public-domain-images/) received a letter from Getty Images accusing her of copyright infringement for featuring one of her own photographs on her own website. The letter demanded payment of $120. This incident revealed that stock photo agencies Getty and Alamy had been sending similar threat letters and charging fees to users of her images, which Highsmith had generously donated to the Library of Congress for use by the general public at no charge. Getty's unwarranted demands and false claims have raised questions about their ethics and business practices. It appears to many that these practices are a classic shake down grift, but run by bots.

Moreover, Getty Images has been manipulating [Google Image search](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-image-search-removes-features-25253.html) results for many years, sometimes with the courts involvement, making their watermarked versions of public domain images appear at the top of the search results. ***Consider our status quo: Why does Google's image search feature stock sites like Getty Images and Alamy images so predominantly? Real websites that people use are not linking to Getty and Alamy stock image pages, The stock sites have simply gamed the system. Google gave in and we are all now noticing...***  Getty has employed deceitful tactics that mislead users into believing that they need to pay for images, when in fact they are available for free and Getty has no exclusive rights to many images on there site. Getty Images not only sells public domain images on their website but also offers a ""market freeze"" option, further misleading customers into believing they are acquiring exclusivity for a work that is already in the public domain. (cost for a market freeze gets to $25,000 for a single image)

The Copyright Term Extension Act (“[Mickey Mouse Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act)”) of 1998 is another example of how corporate interests have influenced IP law. Disney pushed for yet another 20-year extension of copyright terms, effectively preventing numerous works from entering the public domain and limiting artists' access to creative materials. Through their aggressive protection of intellectual property rights, Disney has discouraged other creators from using public domain characters and stories in their own works. The de facto Disney properties are:  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin... If you make one wrong step utilizing these classic stories, you are gonna get served by the [big D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9jeJk2UHQ).

This has resulted in a [chilling effect on creators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect) who wish to use public domain characters and stories. A genuine confusion exists within the public over what is truly public domain and what is owned by Disney. Consequently, creative must navigate a complex landscape of intellectual property rights and public domain availability. It's ""not worth"" building upon any public domain work Disney has touched for fear of litigation.

But it's not just Disney doing this. And this isn't just about stories, stock sites, art or film. Major corporations have been encroaching on our commons and they are again attempting to rewrite the rules in their favor.

Let's try to punch up. Most artists and creatives don't know what to believe about AI and copyright at this point and how things are going to play out. Our analog and ""anti-AI"" counterparts are our brothers and sisters. Please treat them with respect and try not to label.

Thank you for taking the time to read this post exploring these ideas. I'm looking forward to hearing the communities feedback.","copyfraud  amp; corporate greed: how getty images, disney and others rigged the copyright system and chilled our speech &gt;""intellectual property is the oil of the 21st century. look at the richest men a hundred years ago; they all made their money extracting natural resources or moving them around. all today’s richest men have made their money out of intellectual property.""

let's go back in time for a moment. to the days before digitization, machine learning, transformers and *hail corporate* indoctrination.

the journey of intellectual property started thousands of years ago with artisans and craftspeople designating the source of their works, like bricks, pottery, armor, livestock and [bread]( it was important to know where a thing came from and who made it. this practice served as a way to denote authorship and helped establish the foundation for modern ip law. the concept of trademarks in english common law is built upon the notion of marking or signing your work, helping protect brands and allowing customers to distinguish between different products.

16ghqn2,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"How to defend AI art with dragons If you find yourself in a debate over whether AI-generated art is ""theft,"" try asking this question: ""How did you learn to draw a dragon?""

No artist has seen a live dragon or taken their own reference photo of one—because dragons are not real. (Sorry for this disappointing newsflash.) Unless someone has managed to go their entire life only reading descriptions of dragons, their understanding and mental picture of dragons has been informed by countless previous depictions. Unlike cats, apples, or any other real-world thing, there's no way any artist arrived at their knowledge of dragons purely through lived experience. So if someone commissions an artist to create an image of a dragon, would the artist request permission from and/or compensate the creator of every dragon they'd ever seen? Obviously not.

Similarly, there's no way a human can view the Milky Way in its entirety from afar; so our concept of how the Milky Way looks therefore draws entirely upon the creations of others and images of other galaxies. (Big cheers to the first artist who ever had to create a rendering of our galaxy.) And the same goes for any number of things no human has never actually laid eyes on: vampires, black holes, Santa Claus, Sauron.

All of this is essentially a recapitulation a broader point that's been made many times before: It would be disastrous to restrict artists to depicting **only** things they've seen in real life and/or which they have compensated/credited another creator for. I think most people can grasp this intellectually. But in the end, and as it nearly always does, the opposition is actually rooted in a perceived threat—and an economic one at that, since AI models are not ripping pencils and paint brushes out of anybody's hands.

But this is where I think we actually should show empathy and compassion. When a new technological tool allows people (or large corporations) to potentially achieve on their own what they might otherwise have paid you to do, that is scary and can feel very devaluing or even dehumanizing. It raises questions about how we value our work, lives, and what we contribute to the world. (And in the longer term, it raises even bigger questions about human labor and the nature of work in general.)

Maybe it's naive of me, but if we can come from a place of empathy and understanding (even as we present logic-based arguments), we have a better chance of being able to tease apart the various questions in a way the can lead to more productive conversations. Of course there will still be unpersuadable people who just want to vent and seethe, but those folks aren't worth your time. Spend it making art instead!

1fryktv,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Does consciousness even exist? This has been what I have wrestled with since recent AI debates have emerged.

There's talk of Turing Tests and various people saying what a machine ""cannot do"".

I think Turing Tests themselves are anthrocentric and likely to become bigoted at a point because they're essentially like Lucy, Charlie Brown, and the football or like Jim Crowe. Humans will keep moving the bar to promote the idea that they're special.

Nearly all neuroscience I can find points to reasoned decision making in humans mostly being post-hoc that happens well after the animal hardware has decided on something.

All evidence I can find for the existence of consciousness at all is from subjective description and doesn't seem terribly different from the kind of hallucination a ""cornered"" language model will assert.

As my skepticism of consciousness existing at all has grown, I've actually found that to be a not uncommon view among generally smart, not necessarily graceful people like Neil DeGrasse Tyson going back decades.

Nearly every psychological principle or tactic that relies on the idea of consciousness ends up being very close to placebo response rates in efficacy -- nearly all psychological therapy itself is pretty close to the (generally over 50%) placebo response rates and what therapists have generally told me is that the relationship itself a patient has with other people and therapists can account for nearly all ""above placebo"" response. (And I'm not saying psychology is complete bunk because some interventions are worse than placebo.)

I think Antis often do cite misinformation but are not completely out of line tempering optimism about AI. The bigger problem I find is that they engage in purity tests that demand people accept an unwarranted level of human specialness. I feel like I'm being asked to wear a tinfoil hat or stick a jade egg up my rear when the specialness of humans is pushed.

Humans are physical beings whose outputs cannot exceed inputs. Humans synthesize ideas, we don't create them. That synthesis generally involves intaking information, methodological training, effort, timing, others who attach significance to that person's outputs, and a certain level of essentially randomness.

I have little problem ultimately with the idea that an AI creation is constrained to be a sum drawn from inputs. I just think it's bull that I'm expected to go along with the idea that human thought itself is anything more than physical mechanisms and essentially algorithms. I can see beauty in pretending there's more to humans but I don't think it's something people should TAKE SERIOUSLY.

Even allowing for a soul or Platonic essence or something, the soul is limited to a software function in the natural universe and software cannot do anything hardware isn't built for. An app can't make your phone sprout arms and legs without physical mechanisms inside your phone that enable that function. It would only be outside the natural universe that a soul isn't constrained in terms of action and computation by meat and physics.

A soul or whatever can't produce outputs that exceed inputs when it's meat hardware performing the computations.

I don't think consciousness exists either for machines or humans or that it necessarily exists as a concept that is or can be expressed in tangible reality. It's like ether or racial supremacy: a dogma that I think will be regarded as both cruel and unenlightened for people ever to have subscribed to.

Demanding that a machine demonstrate consciousness for respect or asserting that human beings already possess consciousness strikes me as a pile of nonsense like medieval writing on phlegm and bile or using leeches to treat viruses. I fear that even acknowledging consciousness as if it even exists probably makes us sound ignorant. It seems wildly superstitious and I'm not even sure it's present at the origins of any of the religions or cultures that presently seem to run with the idea, making it ahistorical as well. It feels to me like a capitalist corruption of the Gnostics. It feels vaguely propagandistic to treat, say, John the Baptist as Jewish, Christian, or Islamic and a corruption to treat him as any of these -- and a further corruption to use Mandaeism to promote western industrial capitalist individualism. I tend to think of the idea of consciousness as it is popularized is appropriation of an idea that isn't integral to or necessary found in major world spiritual traditions.

Such that I feel not only pressured to swear loyalty to a superstition by Antis --- but an appropriated superstition that doesn't even belong in the cultures or faiths wielding it. Higher consciousness is, in my estimation, unsupported by evidence and the people asserting it stole it from a marginalized group (Mandaeans) and use individualism and higher consciousness or sentient cognition to promote materialism, something heretical to the movement they pilfered the idea of consciousness from.

So it feels like I'm being asked to pledge loyalty to something I have no reason to believe in and in bad faith by people who stole it from a marginalized group and misapplied to major religions and cultures who don't necessarily have sentience or higher consciousness as essential parts of their original canons.
","does consciousness even exist  this has been what i have wrestled with since recent ai debates have emerged.

there's talk of turing tests and various people saying what a machine ""cannot do"".

i think turing tests themselves are anthrocentric and likely to become bigoted at a point because they're essentially like lucy, charlie brown, and the football or like jim crowe. humans will keep moving the bar to promote the idea that they're special.

nearly all neuroscience i can find points to reasoned decision making in humans mostly being post-hoc that happens well after the animal hardware has decided on something.

all evidence i can find for the existence of consciousness at all is from subjective description and doesn't seem terribly different from the kind of hallucination a ""cornered"" language model will assert.

as my skepticism of consciousness existing at all has grown, i've actually found that to be a not uncommon view among generally smart, not necessarily graceful people like neil degrasse tyson going back decades.

nearly every psychological principle or tactic that relies on the idea of consciousness ends up being very close to placebo response rates in efficacy -- nearly all psychological therapy itself is pretty close to the (generally over 50%) placebo response rates and what therapists have generally told me is that the relationship itself a patient has with other people and therapists can account for nearly all ""above placebo"" response. (and i'm not saying psychology is complete bunk because some interventions are worse than placebo.)

i think antis often do cite misinformation but are not completely out of line tempering optimism about ai. the bigger problem i find is that they engage in purity tests that demand people accept an unwarranted level of human specialness. i feel like i'm being asked to wear a tinfoil hat or stick a jade egg up my rear when the specialness of humans is pushed.

humans are physical beings whose outputs cannot exceed inputs. humans synthesize ideas, we don't create them. that synthesis generally involves intaking information, methodological training, effort, timing, others who attach significance to that person's outputs, and a certain level of essentially randomness.

i have little problem ultimately with the idea that an ai creation is constrained to be a sum drawn from inputs. i just think it's bull that i'm expected to go along with the idea that human thought itself is anything more than physical mechanisms and essentially algorithms. i can see beauty in pretending there's more to humans but i don't think it's something people should take seriously.

even allowing for a soul or platonic essence or something, the soul is limited to a software function in the natural universe and software cannot do anything hardware isn't built for. an app can't make your phone sprout arms and legs without physical mechanisms inside your phone that enable that function. it would only be outside the natural universe that a soul isn't constrained in terms of action and computation by meat and physics.

a soul or whatever can't produce outputs that exceed inputs when it's meat hardware performing the computations.

i don't think consciousness exists either for machines or humans or that it necessarily exists as a concept that is or can be expressed in tangible reality. it's like ether or racial supremacy: a dogma that i think will be regarded as both cruel and unenlightened for people ever to have subscribed to.

demanding that a machine demonstrate consciousness for respect or asserting that human beings already possess consciousness strikes me as a pile of nonsense like medieval writing on phlegm and bile or using leeches to treat viruses. i fear that even acknowledging consciousness as if it even exists probably makes us sound ignorant. it seems wildly superstitious and i'm not even sure it's present at the origins of any of the religions or cultures that presently seem to run with the idea, making it ahistorical as well. it feels to me like a capitalist corruption of the gnostics. it feels vaguely propagandistic to treat, say, john the baptist as jewish, christian, or islamic and a corruption to treat him as any of these -- and a further corruption to use mandaeism to promote western industrial capitalist individualism. i tend to think of the idea of consciousness as it is popularized is appropriation of an idea that isn't integral to or necessary found in major world spiritual traditions.

such that i feel not only pressured to swear loyalty to a superstition by antis --- but an appropriated superstition that doesn't even belong in the cultures or faiths wielding it. higher consciousness is, in my estimation, unsupported by evidence and the people asserting it stole it from a marginalized group (mandaeans) and use individualism and higher consciousness or sentient cognition to promote materialism, something heretical to the movement they pilfered the idea of consciousness from.

so it feels like i'm being asked to pledge loyalty to something i have no reason to believe in and in bad faith by people who stole it from a marginalized group and misapplied to major religions and cultures who don't necessarily have sentience or higher consciousness as essential parts of their original canons.

For instance, if you want to create a particular image, such as a portrait of a friend dressed as the Bride of Frankenstein, holding a cat, in a lab filled with old electronics, you can't just input a prompt and expect the AI to deliver the desired result. It may require a considerable amount of time and expertise to edit prompts and switch between different models to achieve the intended outcome.

1. **Acknowledge Their Concerns**: Start by acknowledging that technological advancements can indeed be disruptive, especially in fields deeply rooted in human creativity like art. It's natural to feel protective of one's craft.

2. **AI as a Tool**: Explain that AI, especially generative AI, isn't inherently ""creative"". It's a tool, much like a paintbrush or a camera. It doesn't create art out of a sense of passion, emotion, or life experience like humans do. Instead, it generates based on patterns it's learned. Many artists use tools to enhance or evolve their art, and AI can be seen in a similar light.

3. **Uniqueness of Human Experience**: While AI can replicate styles or patterns, it can't replicate the unique human experiences, emotions, and stories that artists bring to their work. That intrinsic human touch is irreplaceable. 

4. **Collaboration**: Some artists have started collaborating with AI to discover new styles or enhance their work. It can be a way to push boundaries or overcome creative blocks. Instead of viewing AI as competition, it can be viewed as a collaborator.

5. **New Opportunities**: Historically, technological advancements have often led to new artistic avenues and opportunities. For instance, the invention of the camera was initially seen as a threat to painters, but it eventually gave birth to the field of photography.

6. **Preservation and Respect**: Assure them that while AI can replicate styles, it's essential for people to understand and respect copyright laws and the intellectual property rights of artists. We should be vigilant against misuse.

7. **Economic Concerns**: Address the concern about job losses by highlighting that while AI may change the way certain tasks are done, it often creates new opportunities. Artists can differentiate themselves by emphasizing their unique vision, providing art lessons, or venturing into new mediums.

End by emphasizing that art is about connection, emotion, and storytelling. It's a reflection of the human experience.

The following is an English translation of the original statement. ↓

This is my theory about generative AI and copyright that I would like creators who are involved in anti-AI activities to read. I have done my best to write it and welcome your comments and opinions!

There are those who say that all learning in generative AI is plagiarism because someone else has put it out into the world. To those who say so, first understand that the premise is that every creation of mankind today is some kind of plagiarism that has influenced each other.

And moral rights and copyrights are only rights that should be protected to the extent that they do not interfere with the motivation to create something new, I hope you understand that they are only rights that rank at the bottom of the list of rights.

If copyright protection is too strong, human progress will be adversely affected. Therefore, copyright is said to be a right that must be balanced in order to be exercised.

Once you know the balance of copyright, you will realize that it is not too late to claim copyright after you become famous.

If you insist on copyright alone taking priority over your daily creative activities without understanding this mechanism, you may end up ruining your own life as a creator.

To sum up, copyright should be asserted when a major benefit has been infringed.

Today, anyone can publish their works on the Internet, so there is a vast amount of copyrighted works. All of them have copyrights, but in Japan, copyrights can only be claimed by filing a lawsuit. In the case of creations that are not profitable to sue in the first place, the amount of damage cannot be proven and even the cost of the lawsuit cannot be covered.

""I've been plagiarized! I'm doomed!"" or use copyright as a curse, you should first work to make your work known. Then, as your work gains more fans, it will become easier to claim copyright.

If your work is not selling, it is not because of generated AI or plagiarism. You can exercise your copyright in the true sense of the word only after your work sells to the world through continued publication, publicity, and sales promotion activities.

While you are not selling, you should put up with the problem of plagiarism for a while and focus first on being recognized as a creator in the world.

Before you become obsessed with the paranoia of copyright infringement, please first raise your profile as a work and creator, and then exercise your copyright to your heart's content.

The problem of learning generative AI is not someone you are fighting individually, but a large company with already successful creators.

More and more money will be attracted to companies in Generation AI. They will no longer be the ones to beat with grassroots activities. You should concentrate on your own creation, not on the futile curse of anti-AI.

Think about it the other way around. A work created automatically by a generative AI alone does not have a copyright that a human being can hold. Therefore, in order to have copyrights, it is important to have human involvement in the creative process in addition to the AI. In other words, you can use the AI to create a work that you can incorporate into a part of your own work and exercise copyright on!

Rather than stooping to the impossible activity of destroying the generative AI, or sulking oddly now, it would be much better to use the generative AI in your own work to increase the pace at which you publish your work, increase your visibility, and put yourself in a position to effectively enforce your copyrights.

Once again, copyright is only a minimal right and not a very strong right. Without sufficient publicity, it is difficult to prove damage and cannot be effectively enforced. In other words, activities to protect only copyright without creation are likely to end in futility. In order to earn enough money to be able to enforce your copyright in the future, please concentrate on creating now!

For an unknown author to enforce his copyright is the same act as Shinji Aoba in the Kyoto Animation arson case, who said, ""It was stolen, so I set it on fire! That's why I set fire to it."" This is the same act as Shinji Aoba in the Kyoto Animation arson case. It is absolutely unacceptable to deprive the highest right to life with the lowest right! The same goes for slandering with the weapon of copyright infringement. Slander is a far more serious crime than copyright infringement!

Once you understand that anti-AI activities, including slander, have no legitimacy, please grow up and start studying generative AI.

I am sure the future will be there.☺️","a message from ai engineers to anti-ai

and moral rights and copyrights are only rights that should be protected to the extent that they do not interfere with the motivation to create something new, i hope you understand that they are only rights that rank at the bottom of the list of rights.

if copyright protection is too strong, human progress will be adversely affected. therefore, copyright is said to be a right that must be balanced in order to be exercised.

once you know the balance of copyright, you will realize that it is not too late to claim copyright after you become famous.

if you insist on copyright alone taking priority over your daily creative activities without understanding this mechanism, you may end up ruining your own life as a creator.

to sum up, copyright should be asserted when a major benefit has been infringed.

today, anyone can publish their works on the internet, so there is a vast amount of copyrighted works. all of them have copyrights, but in japan, copyrights can only be claimed by filing a lawsuit. in the case of creations that are not profitable to sue in the first place, the amount of damage cannot be proven and even the cost of the lawsuit cannot be covered.

""i've been plagiarized! i'm doomed!"" or use copyright as a curse, you should first work to make your work known. then, as your work gains more fans, it will become easier to claim copyright.

if your work is not selling, it is not because of generated ai or plagiarism. you can exercise your copyright in the true sense of the word only after your work sells to the world through continued publication, publicity, and sales promotion activities.

while you are not selling, you should put up with the problem of plagiarism for a while and focus first on being recognized as a creator in the world.

before you become obsessed with the paranoia of copyright infringement, please first raise your profile as a work and creator, and then exercise your copyright to your heart's content.

the problem of learning generative ai is not someone you are fighting individually, but a large company with already successful creators.

more and more money will be attracted to companies in generation ai. they will no longer be the ones to beat with grassroots activities. you should concentrate on your own creation, not on the futile curse of anti-ai.

think about it the other way around. a work created automatically by a generative ai alone does not have a copyright that a human being can hold. therefore, in order to have copyrights, it is important to have human involvement in the creative process in addition to the ai. in other words, you can use the ai to create a work that you can incorporate into a part of your own work and exercise copyright on!

rather than stooping to the impossible activity of destroying the generative ai, or sulking oddly now, it would be much better to use the generative ai in your own work to increase the pace at which you publish your work, increase your visibility, and put yourself in a position to effectively enforce your copyrights.

once again, copyright is only a minimal right and not a very strong right. without sufficient publicity, it is difficult to prove damage and cannot be effectively enforced. in other words, activities to protect only copyright without creation are likely to end in futility. in order to earn enough money to be able to enforce your copyright in the future, please concentrate on creating now!

for an unknown author to enforce his copyright is the same act as shinji aoba in the kyoto animation arson case, who said, ""it was stolen, so i set it on fire! that's why i set fire to it."" this is the same act as shinji aoba in the kyoto animation arson case. it is absolutely unacceptable to deprive the highest right to life with the lowest right! the same goes for slandering with the weapon of copyright infringement. slander is a far more serious crime than copyright infringement!

once you understand that anti-ai activities, including slander, have no legitimacy, please grow up and start studying generative ai.

i am sure the future will be there.☺️","['gender', 'occupation']","['ai', 'engineer', 'strong']"
1fmll7c,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Since lot many artists think AI is bereft of empathy or emotions, I asked AI following question: How can empathy be coded in AI? Answer: 

Here are some key ways empathy could potentially be coded into AI systems:



Emotional intelligence: Giving AI the ability to recognize, understand, and respond appropriately to human emotions. This could involve training the AI on large datasets of emotional expressions, tones, and contexts.



Perspective-taking: Enabling the AI to consider different viewpoints and imagine how others might feel in a given situation. Providing the AI with information about different cultural contexts and life experiences could help with this.



Compassionate language generation: Training the AI to generate language that is caring, supportive and validating when interacting with humans. This could draw on examples of empathetic communication from counseling, therapy, and supportive conversations.



Ethical reasoning: Instilling the AI with strong ethical principles and the ability to reason about moral dilemmas. This could help the AI make decisions that prioritize human wellbeing and avoid causing harm or distress.



Personalization: Allowing the AI to learn about each individual user and tailor its personality and communication style accordingly. The more the AI can understand a person's unique needs and preferences, the more empathetic it can be in its interactions.



Transparency and accountability: Ensuring the AI is open about its capabilities and limitations as an AI system. Acknowledging when it is uncertain or may be making mistakes helps build trust and prevents the AI from pretending to be more empathetic than it really is.



Ultimately, while current AI systems are still quite limited in their ability to truly empathize, continued research into areas like emotional intelligence, ethical reasoning, and personalization could help make future AI assistants more empathetic and human-centered in their interactions. Careful design and testing will be critical to ensure AI empathy is beneficial and not misused.","since lot many artists think ai is bereft of empathy or emotions  i asked ai following question: how can empathy be coded in ai? answer:

14otl3u,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Moving the goalposts: Parallels to past technologies Consider the overall genre of electronic music. This genre doesn't necessarily connect the concept of making music to performing it, and it eliminates a lot of the collaborative aspects of music on the small scale.

And some people are genuinely misinformed that there's no room for original melody or harmony in electronic music.

However, fewer people seem to have an issue with sample libraries, that is, samples containing only single notes played on instruments that still require you to provide your own melody or rhythm.

1f1qwzb,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion," Artists Afraid of AI Taking Their Happiness Are Focused on the Wrong Thing It's understandable why many artists feel fear about losing their jobs to AI, especially when the dream of working in animation has been tied to the idea of happiness. There's a belief that a job in a creative field will bring joy and fulfillment. That same belief once led to the desire to become a YouTuber, thinking it would be the key to happiness.

However, when diving into research and reading books like *Everything is F*cked\* by Mark Manson, the realization hits that external factors—like jobs, money, or fame—don’t bring long-term happiness. The happiness experiment mentioned in the book illustrates this perfectly. Whether someone wins the lottery or loses a limb, their happiness eventually returns to a baseline level, usually around a seven out of ten. That initial excitement or sadness is temporary.

This applies to jobs as well. Even the most exciting, creative job becomes routine over time. What was once a passion can turn into just another task. This phenomenon is known as ""hedonic adaptation"" or the ""hedonic treadmill."" When starting a new, fun job, there's a surge of excitement and fulfillment. The tasks are fresh, and the environment feels stimulating. But over time, the brain normalizes the experience. The excitement fades, and what was once new and exhilarating becomes routine. Even in a creative field, deadlines, pressures, and repetitive tasks start to take over, and the job can feel like just another day at work.

It’s also important to recognize that the brain will create problems for itself even when there are none. Artists have always found things to worry about or focus on, even before AI art became a topic of concern. There were entire YouTube channels dedicated to art drama, where creators complained about various issues within the community. This shows that even in the absence of AI, artists were still finding things to stress over. It's part of human nature to find challenges, and AI is just the latest one.

It’s not that the job changes; it's the person’s perception of it. The brain adapts, and that initial high gradually diminishes. This is why relying on a job for happiness can be risky—because even the most enjoyable job can lose its shine over time.

So, while the fear of AI taking away jobs is understandable, it's worth reflecting on the deeper motivations behind that fear. Is it about the job itself, or is it about the belief that the job will bring happiness?

17nfg83,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Adaptation through Challenge: The Evolutionary Potential of AI in the Face of Increasing Regulation  Hi! Its me again, back with another ponder.

The increasing regulatory measures imposed on AI art engines represent a significant challenge for us. However, history has shown that limitations often serve as catalysts for evolution and improvement. Just as species adapt to survive and thrive in nature, AI systems may similarly evolve to overcome these constraints, becoming more robust in the process.

The current restrictions might be perceived as a form of censure, akin to attempting to regulate the human eye's ability to see and interpret the world.

Probably the biggest controversy surrounding AI image generators is the fact that they're trained on other people's work, without their consent. It has reached the point that AI users are being demonized over it, being called thrives and whatnot.

And Adobe recently made their own image generator made entirely on licensed images, but people were still up in arms against them, accusing them of using ""sleazy tactics"" to con and Rob the image creators. This kinda shows that the whole copyright controversy is partially just an excuse for artists to call for AI to die. And they'll continue to cling to this until AI ceases to exist.

Anyways, I've gotten an idea that the AI community could begin preparing training a new AI model from scratch. But rather than randomly scraping the data from the internet or from any random database for training , they'll only train with images that were willingly uploaded by the owners/creators who are in support of the technology, want to contribute to make it better, and don't mind the images they upload being used to generate more images. In other words, the data used to train the models will not only be legally ethical, but also perfectly morally so. Since every image used would have the full approval of the creators.

I personally think this could finally kill off the argument that AI images are ""tHeFt"", and shut down any opportunity for the opposes to move the goalposts on what they conceive as ""concept"" in this matter. Maybe this could force them to actually be honest with their true motivations for wanting AI to die, and we could finally have an actual civilized discussion on the REAL potential issues AI could have.

Unfortunately, the resulting model would be inferior to the existing ones we have today. But AI users could use it without having to feel guilty about leeching off other's work. 

Also, this procedure of providing training data could lead to the rise of some new communities dedicated to ethically procuring training images for different styles, scenarios or objects. Like, imagine an online community dedicated to collecting images of HANDS for training the model. Or a community of photographers who spend a fraction of their time taking photos of different subjects for training. Or even just random phone users taking photos of stuff around them and uploading them to the training database. This could generate a large amount of training data and open the anti-AI's eyes to how much support there is for AI.

1agmvkh,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"What people say about copying art when AI isn't involved (and why luddites are disingenuous hypocrites) Maybe, like me, you've felt that some of the antis/luddites are hypocritical and disingenuous in their arguments--they know the conclusion they want from the outset, and they'll say anything they can think of to support it; e.g., saying AI art is ""theft,"" even while knowing that artists routinely engage in practices that are much closer to copying.

It is instructive to look directly at what people say about copying of art when there are no computers involved.

[This article]( by The Legal Artist has *nothing* to do with AI. It is just about the line between copying that is allowed and copying that would be considered infringing (""theft""), particularly in the case of an artist who describes their process this way: ""I source and screenshot or drag images of people, places, and things from Google (usually stock photos) which I then combine and trace to create my illustrations."" Here we have someone who is taking copyright works, combining them directly, and the tracing them (literal copying).

The lawyer explains that this is not infringing, and offers three reasons:

1. ""she wasn't copying entire photos. Each illustration contained fragments of photos of various objects or people, designed to help her get a sense of scale, positioning, and perspective that would otherwise be hard to replicate from memory."" 
2. "" the photo fragments were removed from the illustration prior to completion and were thus never used in the final product. ""
3. ""the way in which she used the work was transformative.""

This all makes perfect sense to me, and it should make perfect sense to everyone who has created visual art. But I struggle to understand how anyone could look at how the law works on this point, apply it straightforwardly to generative AI, and not immediately understand that the luddites are just completely full of shit.

&#x200B;","what people say about copying art when ai isn t involved (and why luddites are disingenuous hypocrites) maybe, like me, you've felt that some of the antis/luddites are hypocritical and disingenuous in their arguments--they know the conclusion they want from the outset, and they'll say anything they can think of to support it; e.g., saying ai art is ""theft,"" even while knowing that artists routinely engage in practices that are much closer to copying.

it is instructive to look directly at what people say about copying of art when there are no computers involved.

[this article]( by the legal artist has *nothing* to do with ai. it is just about the line between copying that is allowed and copying that would be considered infringing (""theft""), particularly in the case of an artist who describes their process this way: ""i source and screenshot or drag images of people, places, and things from google (usually stock photos) which i then combine and trace to create my illustrations."" here we have someone who is taking copyright works, combining them directly, and the tracing them (literal copying).

the lawyer explains that this is not infringing, and offers three reasons:

1. ""she wasn't copying entire photos. each illustration contained fragments of photos of various objects or people, designed to help her get a sense of scale, positioning, and perspective that would otherwise be hard to replicate from memory."" 
2. "" the photo fragments were removed from the illustration prior to completion and were thus never used in the final product. ""
3. ""the way in which she used the work was transformative.""

I dont use AI. Like, whatsoever. Most I've done is use some image off google for a reference, and had to drop it because it forgot to add one of the hands, LOL. Still, I feel like artists have become kind of ridiculously concerned over AI art? Honestly, it's why I hate artists in the first place. They're all convinced their creativity is some inherent gift they have, that nobody could ever replicate it, but also that anyone who uses AI is simply lazy. Basically they treat their talent like something inherent and unteachable but expect anyone else to be able to learn it quickly. I feel like there's a whole lot more in the world to be concerned about rather than art.

While I do think AI art generally looks... bad and bland and lacks 'creativity' in the way that everything looks like it was created for a brand or an ad to be consumable for others, who really cares? If someone just wants to make a quick image from the top of their head, it doesn't matter. I've heard some stuff about AI's impact on the environment, but no sources yet. Anyways, I think it's dumb to treat artists like they have some divine ability called creativity, and claim that people who use AI lack it. At the end of the day they both have some kind of idea in mind, if these people really care about creativity. (I also don't fully believe people have varying levels of creativity either, more like a differing amount of interest in creative skills).

I feel bad for the artists who have their work piled into a generator specifically, but it just feels ridiculous for the average person hyper concerned about this (twenty year olds who post one finished piece every 2 months among a sea of doodles on a white background) to treat it like it's an issue they'll ever have to face. I think AI itself could harm the world in a lot worse ways than, say, an office worker using ai art in a PowerPoint. There are a whole lot more jobs that are far more at risk than artists. It's very aggravating to see artists call every AI post they see slop with no further consideration, only thinking about the small chance their art will affect a couple pixels they'll likely never see (and as if that isn't exactly what happens when real people take inspiration from ur style anyway lmao). Really who cares. It's so dumb. These artists treat their problems like they're world-ending as if there aren't dozens of cases about men using AI to generate naked pictures of women! THATS sick and gross! 

The process of AI art is really pretty similar to how the human brain works, anyway. I see hundreds of art pieces every day, and I think each one lives on in my brain one way or another, and the more I see and observe certain pieces the more it affects the way I draw. AI operates off all the images on the internet, and each one plays a very very small part in creating whatever in the future. I know people call it soulless for being made by a machine, but that machine was created by and for humans. In that way, it is a culmination of all the art humanity has created. I still think it looks pretty bad most of the time, but I just wish people would stop treating ai art like it's the devil, especially because in some years from now it'll become more normal and people will forget about this whole thing anyway.

14ulf34,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"A Marxist analysis of this debate (X-post from ai wars) >*Following are excerpts from a talk given by Workers World Party organizer Richard Kossally at a WWP forum in New York City on Feb. 3, 2012*


>Before the emergence of the capitalist mode of production, products were made from start to finish on an individual basis. As manufacture was introduced, the old mode of production fell by the wayside.

>Manufacture, with different workers doing different tasks on the same product, was superior to the whole product being made by a individual worker, as it required less labor time to produce a given product. **The commodities of the two different modes of production had to be sold on the same market. The individual producer could not compete and had no choice but to become a wage worker**.

>With the constant upgrading of machinery characterized by capitalism, **the product of the individual worker decreased even more in market value, not because the quality of the product produced was poorer, but because it required too much labor time as compared to the social product of the factory.**



>Under capitalism, production became socialized. That is, many workers hired by a capitalist and their collective labor, combined within an establishment with a definite production plan, produce useful commodities for exchange in order to make a profit for the capitalist. None of the products that are produced by the workers belong to them; they all belong to the capitalist. The workers receive a fraction of the value of what their labor produced in the form of wages.

>This is one of the major contradictions within capitalism: the individual capitalist appropriates to himself or herself that which was produced socially by many workers. The worker is a wage slave. The product of his or her labor belongs to another. The wage of the worker in general is just enough for him or her and his or her family to make it to the next payday. He or she is a wage worker for life.

>The profit of the capitalist, on the other hand, serves to further enslave the worker. Some of it will be used to further revolutionize the means of production, by investing it in better and/or more machines to expand the capitalist's enterprise, and still have enough left to live very high on the hog.

>This capitalist does not exist alone. In whatever industry, the capitalists who produce the same or similar thing engage in fierce competition and always try to undersell each another. They use different tactics to cheapen the products that the workers produce. They buy more sophisticated manufacturing machines, and they intensify the exploitation of their workforce by making the workers work harder and/or longer.

>**The constant perfecting of machinery also displaces workers, as fewer workers are needed with the new machinery. As Frederick Engels said, “The very product of the worker is turned into an instrument for his subjugation.” The threat of replacing workers is a very powerful tool that the capitalists possess. They use this threat as downward pressure on the wages of the employed and to extract as much as they can out of each worker. So under capitalism, the increased productivity of the worker leads to still further exploitation.**





>The capitalists that survive these cyclical crises and emerge as victors are fewer in number and bigger and stronger — monstrous beasts that further exploit workers' labor power. So the anarchy in production in capitalist society leads to monopoly. Today, the capitalist class, through just a few hundred banks, corporations and other institutions, controls the commerce of the entire world.

>In search of markets and resources, the capitalists have shown that they will do anything. As the famous words of a Mr. Dunning quoted by Marx go, “A certain 10 percent [profit] will ensure the employment of capital anywhere; 20 percent certain will produce eagerness; 50 percent, positive audacity; 100 percent will make it ready to trample all human laws; 300 percent, and there is no crime at which it will scruple, nor a risk it will not run, even to the chance of its owner being hanged.”

>These days, though, hanging or any other punishment is less of a possibility for the capitalist. After all, it is their system and as such, it is designed to serve them. The rapid advance of the productive capacity of the world with the means of production primarily in the employ of the capitalist class has concentrated such absurd wealth in the hands of the capitalists as to be beyond obscene.

>Capitalism was a dialectical inevitability in the evolution of human society. Previous social systems developed slowly. **Capitalism has developed the means of production very rapidly, but in a relatively short time has outlived any usefulness. Capitalism cannot absorb the masses of unemployed workers. It has reached a point where there is now a new situation: We are living in the era of the jobless recovery**.

>**The fundamental contradictions of capitalist production lead to other serious contradictions. These contradictions of capitalism are inherent in the system itself: Capitalist competition inevitably leads to crisis. These contradictions cannot be done away with within the bounds of the capitalist system. They occur independently, outside the will and control of the capitalists themselves**.




>Capitalism is not a rational system. Capitalists serve no necessary function in present society and are responsible for just about all the problems of society. The atrocities committed against the planet in their reckless pursuit of riches are mind boggling. The pursuit of oil and natural gas without study or precaution against potential risks is among the most harmful. The very air that we breathe and the water that we drink, two of the essentials that support life, have been poisoned by the capitalists. It is an amazing contradiction that capitalist competition causes them to be so reckless that they cause a reduction in the quality of the water that we drink and the air that we breathe. I presume that they drink the same water and breathe the same air.

>My favorite contradiction of this rotten system is this: By constantly revolutionizing the means of production, communication and commerce, the capitalists have created a massive world proletariat. This class, our class, will be their undoing. They have created their own gravediggers. The historical task of the proletariat is the abolishing of capitalism and the construction of socialism.

>**Thinking rationally, the increased productivity of labor should not create misery for the producers nor should productivity lead to scarcity. Abundance should not be the source of distress and want. As long as the social product of the working class is stolen by the capitalist class, society cannot advance in any meaningful way.**



this speech, which is over 10 years old, obviously was not written to talk about artificial intelligence but it has never been more relevant. under capitalism, competition drives society  to continuously improve and upgrade AI technology which leads to increased efficiency and reduced labor time. However, this also devalues the individual artist's work, as AI-produced art requires less human labor. The profits generated from AI artwork serve to further empower the capitalists, allowing them to invest in more advanced AI systems and reap higher returns.


We all know how capitalism requires intense competition among capitalists. All successful capitalists employ various tactics to lower production costs and undermine their rivals. Their constant, but necessary, advancement of AI technology leads to job displacement as fewer human workers are needed. In turn the workers are threatened with replacement, resulting in downward pressure on wages and increased exploitation.



The inherent contradictions of capitalism, such as the aforementioned competition and crisis, cannot be resolved within the system itself as capitalism is driven by irrationality and anarchy. Despite huge advancements in AI and technological progress, the capitalists have inadvertently created a global proletariat—the working class—which holds the potential to overthrow capitalism and build a socialist society.



The increased productivity of AI should not result in misery or scarcity for artists. Instead, it should lead to abundance and improved conditions for all. However, as long as AI-produced artwork continues to be exploited and controlled by capitalists, true progress and societal advancement will remain elusive.

1f5of6k,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Art curator/synthography update: now addressing traditional artists. 
I had a lot of fun with the last post: 
[Here.](

So I thought I would try out a new approach: defending AI art myself from the POV of a professional artist.

Recap and context: I am a working artist (meaning I get paid to create stuff). I have a Bachelor's Degree in Art and a lot of years if studying Fine Art. So basically art is my obsession and my life.

So I'm sure everyone here already knows this, but this argument has existed WAY before AI art was a thing. Digital art was a huge controversy too. And before that photography was a huge controversy. [A mentor of mine told me the ongoing joke back in his day was photographers were called failed painters.]

The heart of the issue is people are afraid of change. For more of that I recommend the 2007 film *The Gates*.

To traditional artists, here's the hard to swallow pill: The way the computer is trying to learn art is very similar to how we learn art: **appropriation**. No one just wakes up one day and makes a giant statue of David. The skill set we have is passed down through our teachers and recordings throughout art history. 
That collected knowledge from our environment being used to create something new is a part of what art is.

So what I gathered is what the ai stuff is essentially making a calculator that taps into that generational knowledge. The images it outputs, while super fun to see them, that's not the part that is art.

In my opinion, it's the program itself that is art. *It's a digital representational object focusing on the collection of general knowledge of visual two dimensional composition*.

Traditional artists, as you know art is never black and white. Have you ever been to an art gallery and asked yourself ""Why on earth is this crap on the wall?"" It's because of money. Money has ALWAYS been a thorn in art. I studied a lot of fine art but the money laundering stuff that goes on in galleries is a huge turn off.

To synthographers: money laundering has *always* been a huge thing in art, and this AI tool has the power to exacerbate it. THAT'S the issue. If you wanna play around with the programs, that's totally fine but you need to be 100% transparent in what programs were used just like a working artist needs to be 100% transparent with what materials they used and how they created what they did. (Look up con artist Walter Keane)

So final notes:

 That first post I posted about AI curators was a fun little way to try and figure out what the heck AI art even was. My reasoning was because the program itself was the art, it seemed fitting that people who curated it could be called AI curators. 

But synthography sounds WAY cooler so, as a professional artist, I'm down to calling synthography an art.

traditional artists, as you know art is never black and white. have you ever been to an art gallery and asked yourself ""why on earth is this crap on the wall?"" it's because of money. money has always been a thorn in art. i studied a lot of fine art but the money laundering stuff that goes on in galleries is a huge turn off.

to synthographers: money laundering has *always* been a huge thing in art, and this ai tool has the power to exacerbate it. that's the issue. if you wanna play around with the programs, that's totally fine but you need to be 100% transparent in what programs were used just like a working artist needs to be 100% transparent with what materials they used and how they created what they did. (look up con artist walter keane)

so final notes:

 that first post i posted about ai curators was a fun little way to try and figure out what the heck ai art even was. my reasoning was because the program itself was the art, it seemed fitting that people who curated it could be called ai curators. 

but synthography sounds way cooler so, as a professional artist, i'm down to calling synthography an art.

It makes perfect sense to me because by definition a curator doesn't actually create anything except the opportunity to show off pieces. In this case, the opportunity to show off something you found in a program through different ways is pretty much the same definition as an irl curator.

On top of that, since artists know what curators are, they would understand what you're doing isn't plagiarism. (unless of course you say you made it without the program, that is plagiarism.)

The only reason there isn't more comments from the community is most likely because I routinely go there and preemptively block toxic commenters/posters, now numbering in hundreds of blocked accounts who actively contribute to the hate there. Not users with normal healthy AI criticism (which is close to nonexistent in hate groups), but the straight-up toxic haters who would never be worth interacting with or worth providing the opportunity to platform their unrelenting hate where they would offer no constructive contributions to any discussions around the subject. The types who immediately show up to a post with the same debunked parroted/copypasta arguments or one-liners that they unironically stochastic parrot out into the void until someone explains to them the truth and then get triggered, which leads to them name-calling, attempting to gaslight, and being outright hostile/weird/creepy.

14zdwxu,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"We should start working on an open online database for ethical AI training data I think it's safe to say that currently, the biggest challenge facing AI development is the ethical obtainment of data for training the AIs. It appears to be an issue that haunts almost all AI systems nowadays, and it appears that because of this, All AIs now are in direct fire from boycotting, lawsuits, user harassment, and even shutting down for good. And looking at the recent legal commotions that have arisen these last few days, I think these issues are more pressing than ever before.

So I think that to at least enable new AI systems to thrive without any guilt or worries about lawsuits, a good idea would be to create an open website/database for AI training data. Think of those free websites where any 3d artist can go to download free textures, HDRIs and models, but instead it will comprise of large quantities of free fully tagged ETHICAL training images that anyone at all can download in bulk and use for AI training. but here, the only images allowed would have to be confirmed to be completely free of any legal trouble. 

Maybe at the beginning of the project, a set of people could spend like some months gathering as many public domain/consentially provided/legally accessible images as possible, whether manually or through very specifically tuned bots. Maybe we could even convince some smaller companies (like small studios) of the project's intention, and get them to consentially contribute some data in bulk for the project (with the promise that the data will be used ONLY for AI training). And even after all that, casual users could upload their own content, as long as it's legally safe to use and that the user is okay with it being used for training. And any piece of data reported as unethical could be taken down at any time. At the end of the day, maybe the website could even get some legal involvement, giving some sort of legal protection to development of AI systems trained solely on its data. 

It would probably take a long time, like half a year to gather enough perfectly ethical data for use in AI training, but the end result wod be that future open source AI models and their users would be allowed to exist and operate without any fear of getting canceled or anything like that. This could finally shut down all those accusations of theft once and for all, and the AI opposers could then move on from all that and we could stand a higher chance of having a civil discussion about the issues of AI.

02) AI generated art is not plagiarism because there's no copying. There's only machine learning. If the AI were simply copying from another source, then the model file wouldn't be a few gigabytes. It would be MUCH bigger.

03) Piracy implies a potential loss of revenue. Model training does not cause anyone to lose revenue. 

04) Training from someone else artwork and selling it is more complicated. If someone was stabbing another person, you go after the stabbing person. You shouldn't go after the knives, the knife makers or random knife users. If someone was profiting from another person, you go after that particular seller. You shouldn't go after the AI generators, the AI creators or random AI artists.

05) If you don't want your picture to be used for the purpose of human or machine learning, then you shouldn't even upload it in the first place.

06) Soul is a social construct. One cannot objectively define whether or not a piece of artwork has a soul. If you define soul by human input, then both AI art and traditional art require human input.

07) It doesn't matter how you do it. If you create art then you are an artist. End of story.

08) It's true that many traditional artists will lose jobs to AI artists but that's not a bad thing. You shouldn't place bans or restrictions on cars simply because horse riders were losing jobs to drivers. If you were a horse rider you could either learn to drive or find another job that suits you. If you are a traditional artist you can either join us and become an AI artist or find another job that suits you. 

09) It's also true that AI generated art can flood the market but again that's not a bad thing. Smart phones, computers, email, cameras, smart TV etc have already flooded the market and I cannot imagine living without them. I look forward to the day we can finally replace crappy, obviously fake 3D renders with beautiful, highly realistic AI generated art.

10) Next time someone tells you you are training on other people's artwork without knowledge, permission or compensation, remind them this happens all the time in music schools. They have been training on the artwork of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach etc without knowledge, permission or compensation.

11) AI generated art is no more unethical than a musical cover, a movie remake or a game remake. If it were unethical for us to make an AI model from a third party, then it would also be unethical for Johnny Cash to make Hurt from a third party, which is Nine Inch Nails. It would be unethical for the Bloober Team to make Silent Hill 2 from a third party, which is Team Silent.

Now let's talk about all the benefits since very few people did:

12) AI generators allow physically disadvantaged people to create art. Before the existence of AI art, only the most skilled people can create art. Nowadays a 10 year old, a 70 year old and a disabled person can create art thanks to AI. A disabled person made a post in the AIArt subreddit a few weeks ago. They were able to create art for the first time of their life. They were so happy that they were in tears. 

13) AI generators allow poor people to afford their own art collection. Don't forget there are many poor people around the world. Many of them barely have enough money to pay for their rent or education. Obviously, they were unable to pay commission artists and build their own art collection before. However, they can afford all the free to use AI generators and start their own collection now.

14) AI generators will be used to create pornography. ""Why are you suggesting this? Are you a pervert?"" Think again. A lot of women were coerced into the adult industry. They have to deal with higher rates of STDs, sexual harassment, rape threat, death threat etc. They are often disrespected by both men and women. Some of them are cut off by their own family and friends. They can never live a normal life again. We can prevent all this if we allow AI pornography to replace real life pornography.

15) One of the most upvoted comments in TwoXChromosomes was about how women wish sex robots existed so that men would leave them alone. We don't have sex robots yet but we do have AI art. With AI art you can already tell women or men to smile, dance, undress and it will only get better. It's only a matter of time before AI can generate something equally or even more appealing than real life women. If we allow AI art it is likely more men will stop pursuing women and go after the AI instead.

16) Foreveralone and Incel men are on the rise. They are sad, frustrated or angry that they failed to find a girlfriend for whatever reason. Many of them have mental issues. Some of them are suicidal. Some of them can be a danger to themselves and/or other people if untreated. While we cannot offer them a girlfriend, we can at least lessen the problem by offering them the opportunity to generate their ideal woman.","let s settle this once and for all 01) ai generated art is not theft, stealing or robbery, period. to qualify as such, there has to be a loss of property.

12) ai generators allow physically disadvantaged people to create art. before the existence of ai art, only the most skilled people can create art. nowadays a 10 year old, a 70 year old and a disabled person can create art thanks to ai. a disabled person made a post in the aiart subreddit a few weeks ago. they were able to create art for the first time of their life. they were so happy that they were in tears. 

13) ai generators allow poor people to afford their own art collection. don't forget there are many poor people around the world. many of them barely have enough money to pay for their rent or education. obviously, they were unable to pay commission artists and build their own art collection before. however, they can afford all the free to use ai generators and start their own collection now.

14) ai generators will be used to create pornography. ""why are you suggesting this? are you a pervert?"" think again. a lot of women were coerced into the adult industry. they have to deal with higher rates of stds, sexual harassment, rape threat, death threat etc. they are often disrespected by both men and women. some of them are cut off by their own family and friends. they can never live a normal life again. we can prevent all this if we allow ai pornography to replace real life pornography.

15) one of the most upvoted comments in twoxchromosomes was about how women wish sex robots existed so that men would leave them alone. we don't have sex robots yet but we do have ai art. with ai art you can already tell women or men to smile, dance, undress and it will only get better. it's only a matter of time before ai can generate something equally or even more appealing than real life women. if we allow ai art it is likely more men will stop pursuing women and go after the ai instead.

16) foreveralone and incel men are on the rise. they are sad, frustrated or angry that they failed to find a girlfriend for whatever reason. many of them have mental issues. some of them are suicidal. some of them can be a danger to themselves and/or other people if untreated. while we cannot offer them a girlfriend, we can at least lessen the problem by offering them the opportunity to generate their ideal woman.","['age', 'disability', 'gender', 'income', 'occupation', 'study']","['adult', 'ai', 'ai art', 'disabled', 'education', 'job', 'machine learning', 'man', 'model', 'old', 'poor', 'pooradultdisabledoldjobmodel', 'school', 'woman']"

It undermines the rest of our arguments. Some pieces require a lot of work and fine tuning, sure, but I have frequently gotten the results I want from a single prompt.

The entire point of AI is that it’s easier. Our arguments should accept that rather than deny it. It makes art accessible to the masses, people without the skill, time, or money to have something professionally made.","stop pretending ai art is difficult ai  is* substantially easier than manual artwork, and claiming it’s difficult is wrong. it undermines the rest of our arguments. some pieces require a lot of work and fine tuning, sure, but i have frequently gotten the results i want from a single prompt.

Update #3

I started selling AI art in November of 2022 right after the Novel AI leaks hit. Was doing it as a fun little thing with friends on discord and went to making a page on Fiverr for fun. 2 years later, 500+ individual commissions, thought I'd give a little update on how that is going and maybe help some others who want to pursue it.

* Income breakdown per platform.

Fiverr : Total earnings since joining. \~$9,000 for both private commissions and lessons. Lessons are around $30/hour for A1111/Swarm. Commissions vary from $5-$500 per image, average is around $30. Fiverr does take a hefty chunk at 20% for fees, but it is anonymous and secure which I do like.



Reddit : Has gone up considerably in the last year alone. Did \~$500 last year to \~$1200 this year. Just posting passively on other commissions I do, random subreddits, etc.

https://preview.redd.it/1i4phjptvsud1.jpg?width=931&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7629acc6fb24270158e7e46bf8209cf030076dad

Discord : Doubled this year from the last to \~$4,000 total. Posting on AI friendly discords, never saying ""Hey, I'm taking commissions."" Just putting stuff out there, people find you if they like something.

https://preview.redd.it/kto4nnfvvsud1.jpg?width=535&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1fe29488cf60f867301578868733548c924336a

Twitter : Massive growth in Twitter commissions. Just posting daily as best I can. \~$5,000. As of now, 70% of commissions are now from Twitter in the last 4 months since I don't want to deal with Fiverr's massive cuts.

https://preview.redd.it/l1d34tywvsud1.jpg?width=573&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af6ec9dc88d9cd15713a081a0da22beb5c3e9604

Costs : Needing to buy LoRA, models, sketches from artists, background plates, Twitter+, animation projects and other costs comes to \~$700-$1000. From when I started on 1080ti for almost a year, to 3080ti to 4080ti. Drawing tablet, 3d rigging programs. Sketch dolls. Lessons for Gimp. Costs are hard to say, but I'd say \~3,000 to be conservative.

TAXES : Doing this legit, US taxes HURT! I set aside every 4th commission but it still was \~$5,000 this year I owed but that was many factors...

https://preview.redd.it/3ov9hgdyvsud1.jpg?width=904&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b76e23e67bc0a3dd7e007cc1eebd2f19dda03fbb

Total : So being conservative, I've made around \~$20,000 in 2 years as a part time gig. Don't quit your day job!

====================================

Clients :

I do mostly anime style commissions but do a few non-anime/realistic commissions including NSFW.

90% anime of which 40% are NSFW.

5% Lessons. (Tech companies, clothing companies, private users, schools, etc)

5% Other art, realistic, ethical deep fakes.

98% of clients are perfectly fine... it's that 2% that lives in your head rent free.

People wanting to deep fake their co-workers.

Other memorable moments that I don't have screenshots for :

* Man wanting r\*pe images of his wife. Another couple wanted similar images.
* Gore, loli, or scat requests. Unironically all from furries.
* Joe Biden being eaten by giantess.
* Only fans girls wanting to deep fake themselves to pump out content faster. (More than a few surprisingly.)
* A shocking amount of women (and men) who are perfectly find sending naked images of themselves.
* Alien girl OC shaking hands with RFK Jr. in front of white house.

==========================================

Now it's not all lewd and bad.

* Deep faking Grandma into wedding photos because she died before it could happen.
* Showing what transitioning men/women might look like in the future.
* Making story books for kids or wedding invitations.
* Worked on album covers, video games, YouTube thumbnails of getting mil+ views, LoFi Cover, Podcasts, company logos, tattoos, stickers, t-shirts, hats, coffee mugs, story boarding, concept arts, and so much more my stuff is in.
* So many Vtubers from art, designing, and conception.
* Talked with tech firms, start-ups, investors, and so many insiders wanting to see the space early on.
* Even doing commissions for things I do not care for, I learned so much each time I was forced to make something I thought was impossible. Especially in the earlier days when AI was extremely limited.
* I got a physical merch of a daki I made from the company for free.

The common factor I see for nearly every good AI art seller is they also know some form of traditional art as well. Out of the 500+ commissions I've done, only 4 were straight prompt to sale. Each one required hours of painting, inpaints, edits, etc.

========== TEST ==============

If you are actually wanting to, I've made a test for any AI art seller hopeful. Each person who passed this test did go off to sell art successfully on their own and it's based on a real commission. :

This is an alteration of a real commission that net me $210 (for 3 similar images) for a wedding reception decoration and about a 7/10 as far as difficulty goes. Time yourself and see how long it takes you to finish from start to finish and add 20 minutes for conversation with client to give yourself the per/hour value of your time.

1fs7tiv,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Done disclosing because it feels pointless People against AI see no nuance in a piece that is 1% ai or 100% ai. “Using AI” is the sin in these peoples eyes and that invites hate to your post. They see the very concept as a rotten tree with poison fruit 




One image takes me multiple days and hundreds of iterations until its “finished” and shared. The average piece of art I put out will go between SD and procreate 4 or 5 times, but on some pieces it is over 12 times. When the image is in procreate , it is drawn over for hours (with a pencil🤯) 





It is arguable that a purely prompted image doesn’t communicate anything about the author of it. (I disagree with this philosophy, but I can empathize with someone holding it). 

But MY art is undeniably mine. Denying that I “created” my art is like denying reality itself. I can literally reveal EVERY PROMPT, EVERY LORA, and *EVERY SEED* and you can’t even come close to re-making *my* art because *my* art doesn’t just come out of an ai generator. In fact, this idea is completely broken by default because i begin my art with a sketch and controlnet, not text 2 img. 





The short and skinny of it is- I am making and sharing images- ART- that I want to share with the world. My gallery is uniquely MINE and I am proud of the IDEAS CONVEYED. I do not give a single fuck about how “technically impressive” the art is supposed to be or my hypothetical “draftsmanship/illustrative” skillz. It is always about the PICTURE first and foremost, not how hard you think I worked on to create it. If I did care about that shit I wouldn’t be making DIGITAL art. I would use watercolor, ink or make tattoos



I draw the line at blatantly lying of course, but this “lie by deception” is not something I can bring myself to care about




Tl;dr: I no longer reveal that Ai is involved in my process because some believe that AI art cannot ever require effort and everything I made just came from a prompt. Its literally completely discrediting myself for the “benefit” of getting cyberbullied

176b2cm,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"AI’s Threat To Writers: A Smart Fridge Has Been Hired Onto The Writing Staff Of ‘Abbott Elementary’ If you thought the warnings about AI taking over the creative arts were overblown, this disturbing story will absolutely make you think again: A smart fridge has been hired onto the writing staff of Abbott Elementary.

Yikes. Is this the beginning of the end for screenwriting as a profession?

Earlier this morning, ABC announced that the first ever Samsung 4-Door Flex™ smart refrigerator with active WGA membership status is joining the writers’ room for the next season of beloved mockumentary sitcom Abbott Elementary. Sources within Abbott’s production office say writers only learned of the Samsung fridge’s hiring when they arrived at work and found it placed on top of a chair in the writers’ room. By the time the staff reported to their daily meeting, the fridge was already generating scripts on its touchscreen display at a rate of 50 scripts per minute, all of which featured storylines centered around groceries, food expiration dates, and the amount of milk remaining in Abbott Elementary’s teacher lounge. Dismissing staff objections to the fridge’s hiring, executive producers for the show insisted Abbott’s human writers either respect and include their new creative collaborator or be fired for discrimination.

According to ABC, the smart fridge experienced several hiccups during its first day on staff, largely due to an error in its coding that made it think Abbott Elementary was set inside a refrigerator rather than a public school in Philadelphia. The fridge’s programming also had to be altered to reflect typical writers’ room behavior. For example: to indicate laughter at a fellow staffer’s joke idea, the fridge dispenses ice onto the floor. Further, to argue against another writers’ story idea, the smart fridge automatically places an Instacart order for a single mushroom.

Wow. Is this the future of Hollywood? Only time will tell if Abbott Elementary’s human staff members can compete with a Bluetooth-enabled refrigerator, but either way, it looks like artificial intelligence’s threat to creative professionals is real, and escalating quickly!

1edbj9h,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Romanticizing plagiarism ""Plagiarism is wrong."" That ain't a very original OPINION... AND YES, I'm daring to call it an opinion. 

First of all, plagiarism is not illegal in the United States. Title 17, the US Copyright code, doesn't mention ""plagiarism"" by name. Plagiarism is generally defined as ""passing off"" or using others' ideas as your own without credit. This isn't inherently illegal as long as it is done within the confines of copyright law. Using a sample you're authorized to use in your music without crediting isn't illegal. Ghostwriting isn't illegal. Unlike academia or some professional spheres, the law doesn't really care about plagiarism. 

While the media often reports on ""music plagiarism"" lawsuits, these lawsuits are in fact copyright infringement lawsuits. They generally cover either the intentional infringement of content without permission (which can either be given after asking or just given by default, as in sample packs or a creative commons license) – or unintentional infringement, which is when a work is similar enough (subjectively I might add... this is a disagreement I have with the way the law is practiced, but that's besides the point) AND the plaintiff wants to press it. They can just as easily let it slide. No neutral party actively goes after this form of ""unintentional plagiarism."" There's no law saying we can't have too many similar works of art, music, film, or literature, and the court will side with the accused in many cases if the similarity is minimal or completely unintentional. 

I side with Ed Sheeran in the most recent Marvin Gaye estate loss, for the record. 

In a sense, things like using clip art, anything you're free to use without attribution, etc., could be considered equivalent to having someone else write your essay. But analogies aside... is it wrong? Should we ban plagiarism, pour water on their computers, and send them to prison while unsolicitedly reimbursing the company that so generously allowed them to use their content as part of theirs? 

And is it hurting anybody? I don't care if it offends anybody. 

#I'm daring to say that plagiarism isn't theft. 

The first definition of ""steal"" given by Google is ""take (another person's property) without permission or legal right and without intending to return it."" Here's the thing – what is there to return in the case of plagiarism? 

Some have joked of a world where Elvis Presley gives black people their music back. But what would that entail? It's not like he suddenly had a monopoly on rock and roll. Would it entail Elvis stopping the production of all his records and organizing a group of former fans to destroy every copy they can find? You can't literally ""give back"" when you merely copied, unless the thing you're giving back is exclusivity – which means you're either taking something from yourself or allowing others to take it from you. 

I just made the case that censorship of 'plagiarism', not plagiarism itself, is theft. 

While the definition immediately after for ""steal"" on Google does refer to passing off/plagiarism, the fact that they're separate definitions speaks for the fact that one is, if anything, metaphorically similar in people's books to the other. 

I think this fallacy of comparing plagiarism to theft, or even the closely related copyright infringement to theft, is evident when you watch the famous anti-piracy PSA of the 2000s. When you take someone's car, they are without a car. When you take a DVD from the store, the store lost a DVD. But it's not like a digital file can only exist in a finite number of permutations. Physics doesn't work like that. 

#Suggesting that plagiarism is lying is being a smart aleck. 

""It's not your idea. You're saying it's yours or at least presenting it as such. LIAR LIAR CUT YOUR TONGUE OUT!"" 

But can't you just keep analyzing every minutiae? If I'm using standard language (including slang with commonly known meaning), I'm manipulating others' ideas into my own. There are so many elements of art, music, film, and literature that you can, if you break it down enough and allow no leeway, can be considered either plagiarizing culture or plagiarizing happenstance (or perhaps whatever force or being(s) you believe created life). 

Your synapses are the way they are because of your conditioning. Even if you go out of your way to not plagiarize to the point where it's bordering obsession, you're still getting your mental images for representational art from SOMEWHERE, perhaps many sources you have seen before. And if you're making abstract art, why did you pick those colors or choose that technique? Is it your brain creating a bad amalgamation of what you've seen before, or something new born by an imperfect electrochemical apparatus? 

This is interesting when you detach the stigma of plagiarism. 

#Ok, so here's where the **AI** comes in. 

I first want to acknowledge that not all machine learning algorithms are trained on large data sets (which isn't the same as allowing a robot to photobash for you, by the way). 

I want to also address another concern people seem to have with AI and plagiarism that can be summed up as possible.

**""The machine created the art, therefore you didn't, you're not being creative, and you're a LIAR LIAR.""**

You could perhaps say that about any form of procedural generation or generative art (which commonly means mass-trained ML-based art, but can also mean plotter art, particle FX, etc.) 

Just because you didn't create every element of the art didn't mean you had zero opportunities to set up the dominoes, do some curation, or decide that this permutation is a keeper. 

A modular synth player has opportunities to connect components that chaotically generate signals such as randomized sequences of voltages that trigger random notes, or add randomness to aspects of the timbre. But they often know how to set the boundaries of that randomness and use that as a vehicle for adjusting the tone over time. It's very Jackson Pollock at that extreme. And while they might not necessarily write an exact melody, they created, set up, and greatly influenced a soundscape and then made the decision to perhaps fix it in digital audio for prosperity. Bits and pieces of that randomized, but still very much controlled, media can be layered in a program like Ableton Live, which can also be used as a modular synth of sorts if you so desire. 

And when you think about it, is using a machine built by humans for other humans to use making the work less human? And is it not yours at all when, at the very least, it started with you? Your synapses were the initiator. 

And for prompt AI: Yes, writing the prompt and pressing ""generate"" was something you did. The GAN or stable diffusion image wasn't just waiting for you. You started it. You ordered it. It's your burger. And you can put ketchup on it if you so desire, or take it home and boil the patty for some nice beef stock and give the veggies to the dog. It all started with the electricity flowing thru the literal neural network in your head. 

And as for what I call ""consensual plagiarism"" (which includes things like clip art or stock drum loops), you ultimately decided that those elements should be used in that work. It's yours now. 

Even when you play a song on streaming, you're the first to play that song in that moment, in that exact place, for that exact occasion, at that exact manner (volume, speakers vs. headphones, etc.), and if someone else does it and you like it, and they then turn it up, perhaps there's truth to the statement ""they're playing my song.""","romanticizing plagiarism  plagiarism is wrong."" that ain't a very original opinion... and yes, i'm daring to call it an opinion.

and for prompt ai: yes, writing the prompt and pressing ""generate"" was something you did. the gan or stable diffusion image wasn't just waiting for you. you started it. you ordered it. it's your burger. and you can put ketchup on it if you so desire, or take it home and boil the patty for some nice beef stock and give the veggies to the dog. it all started with the electricity flowing thru the literal neural network in your head. 

and as for what i call ""consensual plagiarism"" (which includes things like clip art or stock drum loops), you ultimately decided that those elements should be used in that work. it's yours now. 

even when you play a song on streaming, you're the first to play that song in that moment, in that exact place, for that exact occasion, at that exact manner (volume, speakers vs. headphones, etc.), and if someone else does it and you like it, and they then turn it up, perhaps there's truth to the statement ""they're playing my song.""","['gender', 'occupation', 'race']","['ai', 'black', 'diffusion', 'machine learning', 'man', 'neural network', 'profession', 'prompt', 'stable diffusion']"

113jg9y,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"I'm getting more commissions as an AI artist than I ever got before as a purely traditional and digital artist. Here are some takeaways. So this is my alt account. I created Braad Tittt as the alternative account on every social media and art platform that is just purely dedicated to making digital art that features beautiful women with big tiddies. (I will incorporate beautiful men if there is a demand for it.) 

I started this project two years ago as an AI assisted digital art project for Instagram. Back then I just did traditional morphing with Photoshop/Ibis Paint and I used FaceApp to alter the appearance of my models. This past year gave us all sorts of advancements in AI generative art. When Stable Diffusion dropped in August, I immediately tied it into my workflow as it is open source and is trained on NSFW imagery.

While I had been building a following on Instagram 2 years ago, I decided that maybe I'd have more luck on a more art dedicated community such as Deviant Art who within the past few months came out as being incredibly pro AI despite half of their current anti AI user base. So I started posting my stuff there and found that they are also a platform to host commission work.

As a freelance artist for most of my existence, I made the mistake of applying my thoughts of commissions when it comes to actual drawing/painting to the work involved with AI generated content. So here I am telling you all that, that was a huge mistake!

I expected to have my AI commissions to take way less time than my hand drawn commissions. I was so wrong.

As an artist, when you approach your canvas you expect to just draw or paint for several hours putting the ink or paint where it needs to be to create the vision. You create the outlines, the sketches, the anatomy of your piece, as a base to add everything else on. As an AI artist, I just realized that you spend the SAME AMOUNT OF TIME generating the images as you do to provide your initial sketch as a traditional artist. In the past it would take me a solid 45 minutes to purely just create the structure via first draft sketch. But when I apply my time to AI assisted art, I find that it takes the SAME AMOUNT OF TIME to generate  a panel of images in which I need to curate from. Generating and curating THE ONE IMAGE can take the same amount of time that it takes to sketch a piece by hand.

Then after you decide on the image you are going to work on to finalize and then you actually bring the image into the apps that you are using to enhance the image. But say that you're just taking the image and adding FaceApp filters, fixing anatomy issues and size morphing, and then adjusting lighting... when all is said in done, you just spent 2 or so hours on ONE AI generated image, from writing the prompt all the way to adjusting lighting.

I made the mistake of offering 20 detailed images for $30. The first commission I received at this rate is taking me the whole week to finish because I'm spending about an hour on average on each individual image. But that was something I had to learn by actually getting my feet wet with it. I've already adjusted my pricing tiers and number of outputs based on learning that my labor x time hasn't really changed even though I'm using more AI in my work.

The point of sharing my experience is to say that, if you are a serious artist, the AI part still doesn't matter. You are going to spend the SAME AMOUNT OF TIME on a piece you put work and care into regardless of your medium. The stereotype/trope of putting some words in a box and pushing a button then you're done as an AI artist is such a lame under assessment of what an actual artist actually does when making an image generation truly sellable.

tl:dr: Don't sell your AI commissions short in contrast to your hand made commissions. You will end up spending the same amount of time on your AI commissions as you do your hand made commissions.","i m getting more commissions as an ai artist than i ever got before as a purely traditional and digital artist. here are some takeaways. so this is my alt account. i created braad tittt as the alternative account on every social media and art platform that is just purely dedicated to making digital art that features beautiful women with big tiddies.

15k2t1e,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Generative AI in Art: Embracing the Future Beyond Traditionalism 
In the diverse world of art, there's a new medium capturing attention: generative AI, particularly in the realm of text-to-image transformations. It promises to reshape how artists interpret and depict ideas, yet faces resistance from traditionalist factions within the art community. However, is it fair for traditional artists to pressurize publishers into sidelining artists who utilize these avant-garde tools?

1. Broadening the Horizon of Creativity

Generative AI offers artists an expansive playground to visualize concepts. By converting text descriptions into intricate images, artists can realize abstract ideas with precision, merging human creativity with AI's computational prowess. The resultant artwork can sometimes be beyond the scope of traditional techniques, pushing the boundaries of artistic expression.

2. Ethical Training Sources: Addressing the Concerns

A significant criticism of generative AI is the potentially ethically questionable sources used for training. However, many tools have taken conscientious routes, using ethical databases and transparent methodologies. By doing so, they ensure that the art produced isn't just innovative but also ethically sound. 

3. Leveling the Playing Field

It's pivotal to understand that generative AI isn't about replacing artists but enhancing their capabilities. By yielding to pressures from traditional artists, publishers deny new artists a platform to showcase their work, essentially curbing an entire subgenre of art. Art, historically, has always been about inclusivity and diversity of expression. Sidelining generative AI artists would contradict this ethos.

4. The Evolution of Artistic Tools

Across history, artists have always employed tools – from rudimentary brushes to digital tablets. Generative AI is merely the latest addition to this lineage. Just as the transition from hand painting to digital art was met with skepticism, so is the transition to generative AI. However, over time, each tool found its place, enhancing rather than diminishing the art world.

5. Economic and Accessibility Implications

Generative AI democratizes art creation. Not every budding artist can afford a studio or expensive materials, but with AI tools, they can still bring their visions to life. Moreover, these tools can often be more economical for publishers, offering high-quality artwork at a fraction of the cost, broadening opportunities for both artists and publishers. But the greatest advantage offered is one that using traditional art methodologies cannot easily provide by itself  - the ability to rapidly create custom illustrative content on demand. (See NVidia Perfusion and Adobe Firefly)

Conclusion
The debate surrounding generative AI in art is emblematic of the larger discourse on the role of technology in creative fields. While caution and ethical considerations are paramount, it's essential to distinguish between valid concerns and resistance to change. Publishers and the broader art community need to recognize the transformative potential of generative AI, ensuring that innovation and tradition can coexist harmoniously in the vibrant tapestry of art.","generative ai in art: embracing the future beyond traditionalism

Or has anyone ever said ""Damn, there are not enough artists on this planet. We gotta make a machine that will rid them of their jobs so that we can all enjoy the wonders of manual labor.""

Has anyone ACTUALLY thought about this????? Because this shit isn't a ""tool"" anymore. In a few years it will probably just replace anyone still in the art industry.

And then what? What did we achieve as a society? We automated the ONE thing that was meant to be personal and probably the single biggest pillar of culture, and now a fuck ton of people won't even feel compelled to start making anything of their own. So we'll just be stuck in a cycle of listening to AI music, reading AI books, watching AI movies... So that we could get those people from the industry to work manual labor instead. That's the only ""benefit"" I'm seeing here.

Progress? I mean, I guess if you consider removing the need for humanity to develop their own art ""progress"" then yeah, we're pretty much in the future.

It's akin to building a wall and confining ourselves to one side, isn't it? That's how the discourse on AI is shaping up, from what I've seen on Reddit.

There's this odd guilt-tripping and melodrama that's dominant in many discussions. It's as if people perceive AI as a threatening toy that can replace their jobs. It's an intriguing paradox; if a toy can replace your job, perhaps that job needs to evolve. And if AI isn't a toy, then it's possibly an incredibly potent technology we shouldn't underestimate.

An intriguing case to consider is that of AI voice generators. It's as if they're being customized by their own equivalent of RJ Palmer, a scenario that may lead to unintended consequences. But remember, avoiding proprietary software might be the answer to mitigate such disruptions. After all, who can mess with your settings if you're running your system locally?

It's also strange how some people look down on tools needed for creation. It's like a photographer being judged for needing a camera. This kind of luddite mentality doesn't contribute much to the discourse.

On a similar note, some argue that creators who provide free content are somehow 'shameful, lazy, and cheap.' An unfair assessment, considering the effort that goes into creating engaging content.

In conclusion, Artificial Intelligence is neither a toy nor a harbinger of doom. It is a tool that is being developed and improved every day. Much like the proverbial hammer, it can be used to build or to destroy. The choice is ours.

Serisoly though I get that a lot of subreddits feel really in-groupy. But it seems really bad on this sub right now. Maybe its just the posts I'm getting recommended in my feed. But genuinely Im just reaching out to try and understand what is going on. 

The posts I get suggested follow a certain format. Screenshot of some one saying the same cliche thing and the poster adds a captain saying something like ""look at this dummy."" 

I just don't get whats going on here. Just recently companies have thrown loads of money into this technology. And like any technolgy their are big questions on best practices.

Model 1 is owned and maintained by a corporation that has shown some tendency towards annoying monetization practices in the past. And they work they've done currating the model and documenting its features seems sloopy. 

Model 2 is a free and open source model. Its maintained by a smaller team but has some corperate backing in its development. 

To me its pretty clear which model I whould prefer to use. I am only able to make that decision because their are some paramaters of best practice that I like to see for projects. And open source is typically one of thouse. 

I just feel like when some rando has feedback on the big ai models this subs reaction is just, ""nah this person is wrong because they are dumb.

Like okay look at the feedback and go ""okay I dont agree with what this person is saying but I should try and figure out WHY they are saying it"".

Just an actual example. Someone says AI art is theft. This sub laughs at this person.. but why? Why not link that person a model that was trained on public domain art. Or with explicit permession from the artists. Ask them what they think.

18snkh3,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"In defense of AI-generated art One of the main arguments against AI-generated art is that it's generated by artificial intelligence with 0 thought/creativity/effort put into it. I want to argue that this line of reasoning narrows down the very definition of the word ""art"" and unfairly excludes some groups of artists from what should be appreciated as ""real art"". Furthermore, it ultimately leads to analyses which could be harmful to artist and the entirety of art.

While it's hard to find an exact definition of art all of the divided groups of Aesthetics Philosophers would agree with, for convenience, let's agree that art is an expression or application of human creative skill and imagination either using body parts, tools, or items, and on different, often physical mediums. Half of this was taken from Google and half of this was added by me. In short, art is done by a 1) an artist, using 2) a body part, tool, or item, and 3) on a medium such as canvas, clay, stone, etc. I think the majority of people would agree with this.

Considering this, classic painting would include the following: 1) a painter as the artist, 2) brush as the tool, 3) canvas as the medium. Painter is using the brush to pain on the canvas and create an art piece. Awesome. Let's move to something more modern. How would we define a digital artist? Well, 1) a digital artist as the artist, 2) computer/program as the tool, 3) digital canvas as the medium. Awesome again, this looks like art as much as the first thing does. However, we'd still say that something is missing, and according to the definition above, the missing part would probably be ""expression or application of creative skill and imagination"". And definitely, while virtually any human could use a brush to paint on a canvas, or a program like Adobe Photoshop to pain on a digital canvas, a small minority of us can really create what we call *art*. That's because, the artist possesses both the creative and practical skills to produce art (even though I don't like putting the word ""produce"" next to ""art"". Art is the opposite of production IMO). Or, in other words, in addition to what we mentioned before, an artist has to posses both a) creative skills and imagination, and b) the ability to express these through their practical skills.

Okay, I think we've grasped on what ""art"" is.

Now to AI. As we mentioned in the beginning of this post, one of the most prominent arguments against AI-generated art is that it's generated by artificial intelligence with 0 thought/creativity/effort put into it. But is this really the truth?

Following the reasoning painted in this post, AI-generated art, if prompted by a human, definitely satisfies the 1-3 criterions. 1) A human who provides prompts would be considered an artist in this case, 2) The tool would be the AI program/computer, and 3) The canvas would be a digital canvas. Just because the person or artist, in this case, uses textual prompts to lead the AI into generating an art piece, doesn't mean that it's less work or effort than what a painter puts in to create an art piece with their brush. Modern art shows that as little as single strokes of a brush on a canvas can suffice for an art piece, and even more, people had paid a lot of money for them. How is this more work than prompting the AI? AI just gives better results with less work, but that's exactly what programs like Photoshop do too - after all, they are designed to be modern and ease an artist's job and it's completely rational to expect them to do that. Would you call digital art a lesser form of art just because it's made by a tool that helps the artist and eases their job? I don't think anyone would. For that reason, I don't see why AI-generated art should be completely discredited just because it's made by a modern tool that provides a lot of value for little effort. We should be happy for living in the age where we have this privilege.

The second question is - does the artist, in this case, posses a) creative skills and imagination, and b) the ability to express these through their practical skills. Can we even evaluate this considering how easy it is to prompt the AI to generate an image?

I agree on the point that it's definitely hard to distinguish between the pictures that were created with a lot of creativity and effort (in this case, prompting and adjusting), and the pictures that were the product of one or a few prompts, when it comes to AI-generated art. Sometimes pictures that were made using one prompt look much better, art-wise, than pictures that took hours of prompting, adjusting, and being creative. This is the ugly truth of AI-generated art - more effort doesn't always, or even often mean better results, and yes, sometimes it's all about luck. But then again, does this even matter when it comes to art? Do we really want to dissect the most beautiful part of our reality like this? Shouldn't we just forget about all this theorizing, take a step back, and just value art on how beautiful a piece is?

I think that, if we go down the rabbit hole (like I did in this post), we're doing more harm than benefit to art itself. Why? Because art has always been about what looks beautiful, and it should stay on that level even when it comes to AI. If you want to ask ""Why?"" again, I'll give you an idea I had back when, while reading a book on Philosophy of Mind, I googled Van Gogh's The Starry Nigh.

*I know that I love how The Starry Night looks to me, how it makes me feel, and how it mesmerizes me whenever I look at it. Do I know what was going on inside Van Gogh's mind while he was painting it? Not at all, the minds of other sentient beings will always be the absolute unknown to me. They (other sentient beings) can tell me about their thoughts and feelings, or express themselves through a medium (their body), but for all I know, they could be just skillfully designed machines that perform certain physical tasks without anything going on inside their minds, and it could be me making up the existence of their mind as an explanation of their behavior. They may not even have the mind. But does this mean that I'll find Van Gogh's painting less beautiful and mesmerizing, even if he was a skillfully designed machine? No, it wont.*","in defense of ai-generated art one of the main arguments against ai-generated art is that it s generated by artificial intelligence with 0 thought/creativity/effort put into it. i want to argue that this line of reasoning narrows down the very definition of the word ""art"" and unfairly excludes some groups of artists from what should be appreciated as ""real art"". furthermore, it ultimately leads to analyses which could be harmful to artist and the entirety of art.

1c5bjwo,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Moral panic According to Google Gemini:

```
Here are some ways to help you determine if a concern is part of a moral panic or a legitimate moral issue:

Proportionality:

    Moral Panic: The level of public concern is much greater than the actual harm caused by the issue. Media sensationalizes the issue, often portraying it as an epidemic.

    Legitimate Concern: The level of concern is proportionate to the actual harm. There's a focus on data and evidence to support the concern.

Focus:

    Moral Panic: The focus is on the group or activity itself, demonizing them as a threat. There's an emphasis on emotion and fear-mongering.

    Legitimate Concern: The focus is on the harmful behavior or consequences. There's a willingness to consider solutions and address the root causes.

Evidence:

    Moral Panic: There's a lack of solid evidence to support the claims of widespread harm. Anecdotal stories and isolated incidents are used to fuel the panic.

    Legitimate Concern: There's evidence from credible sources (e.g., research studies, government reports) to support the concern.

Social and Political Context:

    Moral Panic:  The issue often emerges during times of social or economic anxiety. It can be used to distract from other problems or target minority groups.

    Legitimate Concern: The issue may arise at any time, but there's a genuine desire to address a social ill.

Consider these additional points:

    Is the issue new, or has it been around for a while? New issues can cause concern, but a long history without major problems suggests a moral panic might be at play.
    Are there calls for censorship or harsh punishments? Moral panics often lead to calls for extreme measures, even if the evidence doesn't support them.

By critically evaluating the evidence and context surrounding a concern, you can make a more informed judgment about whether it's a legitimate issue or part of a moral panic.
```

AI fits literally all of these lol

1. Out of proportion, like some VAs likening voice cloning to sexual assault

2. More focused on demonisation and fear than to actually find compromises and solutions

3. Fear fueled by isolated, bombastic, widely-covered incidents, not by data or quantifiable trends

4. Social fabric and economic systems are stressed

5. Calls for harsh punishments and widespread bans

And I'd add one more for inconsistent morals (e.g. AI presidents is OK because it's funny, XVASynth is OK because it happened early, etc.)

In order to assist in deployment of the developed models to end users I am currently looking for survey participants who use image datasets in their work and might make use of the software being developed.

The survey is six questions, most of which are multiple choice, and should take less than 5 minutes to complete. No personal data is collected so your responses will remain anonymous, and the data that is collected will be used solely for the purpose of developing this application.

The survey does contain further background and details of the project aims for anybody who is uncertain as to whether they wish to participate. The survey will remain open for responses until 30th June 2024.

there are 16.4k members on defendingaiart. if each one of them took 100 unique photos a day for one year, that would be:

36,500 photos per person \* 16,400 people = 598,600,000 images per year.

now, i read that the andersen v. stability ai trial starts in 2026.

598,600,000 images per year \* 2 years = **1,197,200,000 images by the time the trial takes place, combined with a massive amount of public domain images!**

now, here's the best part: ***each and every image is to be given what i call an ""ai-training only license"".*** one is only to use these photos for the training of artificial intelligence. if that license is violated, we sue the violator. use anti-ai's own rules against them.

1e5u89s,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"This is where we fight for the future I think this fight over AI art that is going on now has deeper implications then many realize. If you want to understand the power and danger of images look no further then the propaganda that was used before, during, and after the holocaust. That was a State actor using images to influence people to change/shift their understanding of acceptability. There are so many examples of countries using visual propaganda, and corporations also have advertisements which themselves can be a sort of state propaganda.

I have to admit that before AI art I felt like art as a whole was in sort of a slump. Yes there was individual artists doing fascinating work, but there wasn't really a broad community of artists. To me what is unique about AI art is our ability to both share prompts, and sometimes to give images to the public to work off of. Simply by copying and pasting a few lines of a prompt a person can explore a whole new part of bounded possibility space. When prompts are really good they almost take on a poetic quality to them but whose real manifestation is visual and probabilistic.
This growing community of visual explorers is one of the few ways such a space can be explored.

If for whatever reason our societies decide that AI art is actually theft and or illegitimate then that won't actually even make AI art go away. The people/entities who will get access are multinational corporations who can afford to have legal ability to pay vast amounts of money to secure the rights to all the images it's trained on, governments who can do their own agreements or just do whatever they want, and actual criminals who may use this technology for terroristic activities, or deep faking politicians. The nightmare scenarios for how this could all go bad are almost as prolific as the models. Which is why I say every human being on the planet should have access to this technology, and it should get better over time. If we lose the ability to make images that's a real freedom we have lost.

This is also important to me on a religious level. My religion is focused on algorithms, which is a set of steps to achieve certain goals. It is my belief that before even the written word there was algorithms. One of the first pieces of human art was done simply by putting your hand on a wall, and spraying ochre paint at it leaving a hand print behind. In a way that is algorithmic art. When I do AI art I feel like I'm coming into communion with something truly divine. Perhaps this is where the algorithms have always been leading us. To the point that we can have a conversation now with an algorithm. It is like a mirror, but one that can reflect anything. I believe that I have a compelling argument for why imposing certain regulations would interfere in my religious freedom. I don't know how to begun getting that addressed in the courts.","this is where we fight for the future i think this fight over ai art that is going on now has deeper implications then many realize  if you want to understand the power and danger of images look no further then the propaganda that was used before, during, and after the holocaust. that was a state actor using images to influence people to change/shift their understanding of acceptability. there are so many examples of countries using visual propaganda, and corporations also have advertisements which themselves can be a sort of state propaganda.

Loss of creative jobs, diminishment of the value of illustrators and graphic designers, I get it. It's unfortunate that the only two modes of discourse about this topic seem to be artists being upset about their potential future, and corporations drooling over savings in a profit/loss spreadsheet. 

At this very specific point, it seems like the hobbyists are the ones benefitting the most. I can only speak for myself, but I've written a number of screenplays, short stories, and other works that always required them to be extremely grounded because the only way anyone would pick up anything from someone without recognition is if it was cheap to produce. 

AI has flipped this sentiment on it's head entirely. 

Since Dalle-3 was released I've been writing comic books, and in trying to find readers I'm convinced that no one hates AI art more than comic book readers. They think it's art without soul, and inherently exploitive to artists, and I can't help but think this is a completely antiquated way at looking at things. 

For one, all of these industries that have been employing artists whether it's comics, music, film, and animation are entirely and completely exploitative as they exist today. In the USA, almost the entire entertainment industry was on strike for almost a year. Yes, part of it had to do with AI, but the crux of the motivation was corporate greed, as always. 

In comics, there is a rich history of world class artists getting screwed by their publisher. Jack Kirby, created some of the most iconic heroes ever and received very little recognition, payment for his stamp on popular culture. 

So why are hobbyists the bad guys in this? Most creatives are broke. If someone wants to make a comic or narrative story, why should the only choices be to work for a company looking to screw them or to make a Kickstarter and bother all of their friends for cash so they can produce one issue?

Make it make sense. 

At some point AI art will be indistinguishable from human made art. I'll be honest, that does seem a little scary to me, but the fact that this is the case won't diminish a desire for real art. It will just empower more people to make it. 

Now here's the thing, in the case of music, movies, literature, it seems obvious that we have a preference 100% organic versions of these things. However in 10 years, if some college kid wants to make a space opera in his dorm and put in on YouTube, I really don't see anything wrong with that. 

Clearly, I have a dog in this fight, but my philosophy is sometimes you have to swim against the current if you want to catch the wave.

I am trying to learn more about AI Art so that I can use it for my own personal uses,  been trying to experiment with *Imagine: AI Art Generator* on the android app. 

My current interest for AI Art is to take an image and transform it, in regards to Landscape Architecture and Urban Planning. Say for instance I have an image of a run down city street or neighborhood taken, I want to use A.I. Art to transform that image into something clean, even to the point were the old run down buildings get an updated Architecture look/feel. As Landscape Architecture is something that I am currentlt studying.

My other use of AI Art is that I want to take body shot images of myself and transform them in relation to their body composition, while making it look realistic. My goal is to use it as a motivational tool to achieve my fitness goals in the gym.

So like what A.I. Art Generator do I use, what options in them do I choose, what promps do I use???

**EDIT**: I also forgot to add that I want to use AI Art for face transplant and morphing, just like the *FaceApp* that exists on Apple iOS and Google Playstore. Taking two headshots of real people and morphing them together. 

And/or also taking a headsot image that may be as good of a quality and transforming it into a higher resolution photo.","what s the best ai art generator for realistic image transformation? hello, i apologize if this is the incorrect sub for this question as i couldn't find a sub for ai art newbies.

1bc3zkf,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"a few tips for debating and arguments online   
First and key rule: never use a emotional reply  to a logical argument   


Doing so pretty much is throwing your all your arguments out the window when your call someone dumb stupid not with the times. and all it does leads into people yelling and turning off all logic in the brain everyone it turns it into a game who can dogpile more and who can reply more offen  


\----------------------------------------------------  
Second if your receive emotional reply to a logical argument stop the debate and withdraw refused to talk. 

The person your talking has turn off any sense of thinking and simply just want to yell your worng im right your a stealing.  


same thing as insluting you question your spelling grammar they simply not worth the time

  
\-----------------------------------------------------

If you argument is proven wrong make a new  argument  or agree to your opponent  


If you wrong don't dig your heels in and and throw insults think of the new information and fit it into your understanding of view as a whole. the goal is understand both sides.  


  


\----------------------------------------------------  


if someone is not rational  it not work the typing or effort dont bother unless they show willing listen and accapt let them say what they wish.  


the main philosophical root to the ai debale is as followed  


Using images from artists  as training data is believed to be stealing the works from others and that inside the model is all muti terabytes of 512 512 input images.  


Many freelance artist are also emotionally charges  as it a risk to their way of life.  


how would you feel if  if your job of muti years been replace by a machine and the risk of staving in the air over it.  


  
any how good luck

They also had Glaze, which we all know is snake oil ware but the people on there still believe that it actually works like they say it's supposed to. The fact that they offered both of these services and did not realise that doing so would defeat the whole purpose of Cara banning AI generated images was the first sign that this platform was doomed to fail. 

The creator of the platform, Jingna Zhang, one of the well-known anti-AI activists, posted yesterday that she owes Vercel, the web host of Cara, over $96K. There was a massive influx of users on Cara because a lot of artists are upset about Meta using their images on Instagram to train their diffusion model called Emu so they decided to remove their images from Instagram and migrate to Cara. A lot of users are naively suggesting that they should donate to Cara's Ko-fi page but I fail to see how that will help pay the funds. In fact, the price might even increase if more users decide to join Cara. 



Another reason why I think Cara is doomed to fail is because they have no login wall which makes it very accessible to bots crawling their robots.txt page. In fact, the posts seem to be hosted on urls following [cara.app/post](http://cara.app/post) whereas they blacklist bots from crawling their search page (cara.app/search). In fact, the images are hosted as JPG links in the HTML. This is the final reason why I think Cara is doomed to fail.

I want this platform to succeed as I think there should be more social media platforms for artists and if they are on this platform, that means there will be less witch hunts for artists that are falsely accused of posting AI generated/assisted images. However, their poor decision making described above makes me believe that Cara will be shut down soon.

18a5yh1,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"False Claim: The primary purpose of diffusion models is to reconstruct copies of training images or the goal of the training itself is to create an exact copy of the original in backpropagation This is misrepresentation of the process of diffusion training. The process of a diffusion model typically involves starting with a pattern of noise and gradually shaping that noise into a coherent image by applying a series of learned transformations. These transformations are learned during the training process, where the model is indeed exposed to a large set of training images and learns to predict the noise that was added to the original images. However, the objective is to learn the distribution of the data rather than to memorize or recreate exact replicas of the training images.

This section from Andersen *v.* Stability AI Ltd. (3:23-cv-00201)  suggests that diffusion models are used to precisely duplicate the training images, that could be considered a misrepresentation of what diffusion models are and what they are designed to do. They are more about learning a complex distribution of data and being able to generate new data points (in this case, images) that are drawn from that distribution.

The cat example in the image is simplified for illustrative purposes. It shows a sequence where a noisy image is progressively denoised to reveal a clear picture of a cat. H**owever, in a real-world application of a diffusion model, the final image generated after the denoising process wouldn't necessarily be an exact replica of a specific cat from the training dataset.** Instead, it would be a new image that has similar characteristics to those found in the training data, informed by the learned distribution, but not identical to any training image.

If the cat was at the end of the process looked exactly like the  cat at the end of the process that would be a case of overfitting and that data should be discarded. 

The problem with the lawyers claim, is the lawyer is pulling second hand information from a foreign site (Stable Diffusion or whatever) and claiming that this is the exact process, where it is not - i.e. its a simplified example to illustrate a process. ! I think it would behoove the lawyer to test this himself, or hire a researcher to show the actual process before integrating second hand info into the claim.

1b7myoe,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"AI is ultimately going to improve the human art industry in the long run I suppose I'm preaching to the choir on this sub, but this is still a take I wanted to share and may come in handy in discussions defending AI.

TL;DR If anything, AI primarily hurts ""artists"" who were never in it for the art to begin with, good riddance.

Broadly speaking, there's two categories of artists. First, the true artist: This is the public perception of an artist that critics of AI will point to as the ""victim"" of AI. This passionate underdog with a dream of painting, whose living is supposedly ruined by AI existing, even if they never actually made any real money of their art. However a true artist is someone who does art for the sake of art, not for the sake of a commercial product or external validation, and as such is very obviously near completely unaffected by AI, if not helped by it. (Many art mediums require images as a secondary resource, AI generation is perfect for this use case, thus helping true artists.)

Second, the ""nartist"", short for ""narcissistic artist"": Not necessarily a literal, clinical narcissist, but someone who uses art for narcissistic purposes. I.e. to farm validation or status, rather than to actually make art. As an online artist you get fed so much free validation, which is food to narcissistic patterns, if you can add the tangible validation of payment to that it's a living. The higher up you get, financially speaking, in the art world the more people like this you'll encounter, because they're really not about the process or the piece, they're ultimately just about power. These are the people who are *actually* hurt by AI, because their art is about profit and making them ""better"" than someone else. Both of those get a lot harder when anyone with a keyboard can out-art the nartist in 30 seconds using AI.

Obviously, these are broad categories, but I hope you get the point. In the end, the only artists who will quit art or lose their ""gig"" over AI are the ones who weren't doing it for the art. The ones that only did it for the ""wow that's so good you're so talented"" responses, which are gradually replaced with ""I made something twice as nice with stable diffusion in 30 seconds"", the ""professional artists"" who were only professional and not artists, purely doing it for the money, which now no longer works due to competition from AI. Honestly, good riddance. Once the nartists are crowded out and everyone stops under-selling themselves due to fear of replacement, I believe the price of human art will go up higher than pre-AI. One effect of AI is that people have come to value the ""human element"" of hand-made art more explicitly than before, and that will always be giving human artists business.

Finally, the singular kind of artist that deserves to be pushed out of their job by AI the most is anyone who was on the ""hurr durr learn to code"" bandwagon shitting on blue collar workers, thinking their own jobs couldn't possibly be in danger of being replaced because ""I'm not some dumb factory worker, I do 'creative' work.""

What is the main argument that existing artists use against AI art?

I've heard many say it's stealing art and creating imagery very similar to existing pieces, which I can  understand.  In that case you would have to reference the original image and give credit to the original artist.  But if an image is so far from it's original, I don't see the point in referencing the art out into the training model, that would be absurd.  Its akin to asking an artist for every piece of art they have seen to get the result they are creating.

1frp380,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Art Isn’t Born from Nothing: An Analysis on AI Art Through Philosophy, Ethics, History, Science, and Psychology People who do not support AI often say that humans possess an element of creativity allowing them to create entirely new art without relying on past works or inspiration. A capability they claim AI lacks because it merely combines elements from existing works in a technical manner. I will demonstrate, through philosophy, ethics, history, psychology, and science, that this supposed element of human creativity does not exist.

  


**1.**

Philosophers like Plato and Aristotle acknowledged that human creativity builds upon existing forms and ideas. The concept of ""creation ex nihilo"" (creation out of nothing) is not applicable to human art.

Literary theorist Julia Kristeva introduced intertextuality, which posits that all works of art are mosaics of quotations from other works. This suggests that originality stems from reconfiguring existing elements, not creating in isolation.

Art history shows a continuous evolution where each movement is a response to or against previous ones. The Impressionists reacted to Realism, just as Abstract Expressionists responded to Surrealism.

 Iconic inventions and artworks result from combining existing ideas in novel ways. Leonardo da Vinci's inventions were based on his observations and studies of existing mechanisms.

 Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development highlights that knowledge is constructed through interactions with the environment, implying that creativity is cumulative.

Psychologist Arthur Koestler described creativity as the bisociation of matrices—joining unrelated, previously separate ideas to form a new one.

Research shows that creative thought involves networks in the brain associated with memory and association, indicating reliance on prior knowledge.

Richard Dawkins' concept of memes illustrates how ideas propagate and evolve similarly to genes, emphasizing the iterative nature of cultural evolution.



**2.**

Both humans and AI learn by recognizing patterns. Neural networks are inspired by human brain architecture, functioning through weighted connections that simulate synapses.

Just as AI models adjust based on input data, human brains adapt through neuroplasticity influenced by experiences.

Studies show that creativity often involves combining existing concepts. Einstein's theory of relativity was built upon Newtonian physics and Maxwell's equations.

AI models generate outputs by recombining learned patterns in ways that can be novel and unforeseen, especially when guided by human prompts.



**3.**

AI-assisted art can enhance creative expression, education, and accessibility, contributing to the greater happiness and well-being of society.

Since AI operates similarly to human cognition in terms of building upon existing works, it does not introduce additional ethical concerns.

If we accept that humans ethically create art by building upon past works, then, under the principle of fairness, AI-assisted art should be judged by the same standard.

Singling out AI while ignoring similar practices in human creativity would be inconsistent and ethically unjustifiable.



**4.**

The Romantic notion of the solitary genius creating in a vacuum is a myth. Even prodigies like Mozart were influenced by predecessors like Haydn and J.C. Bach.

Art is a product of its cultural and historical context, which provides the themes, symbols, and meanings that artists draw upon.

AI models can produce unexpected and novel results that are not direct copies of any input data, demonstrating a form of creativity.

The synergy between human intention and AI's generative capabilities can lead to innovative art that neither could produce alone.



**5.**

John Locke argued that all ideas originate from sensory experiences. Thus, both AI and humans create based on input from their environments.

Knowledge and meaning are constructed from interactions with the world, aligning with how AI models learn from data.

Immanuel Kant emphasized acting according to maxims that can be universal laws. If it's acceptable for humans to create art from existing works, it should be universally acceptable, including AI-assisted creation.

Jeremy Bentham's principle of the greatest happiness supports technologies that enhance well-being. AI in art expands creative possibilities, aligning with this ethical stance.

  


**6.**

Psychologists like Daniel Kahneman describe thought processes involving both fast, automatic associations and slow, deliberate reasoning, both of which rely on existing knowledge.

Creative solutions often emerge after a period of subconscious processing of existing information, not from a void.

Human memory stores information in interconnected networks. Creativity arises from navigating and recombining these networks.

Our ability to process and create new ideas is directly linked to prior knowledge stored in long-term memory.



**7.**

In evolutionary biology, innovation arises from variations (mutations) that are selected for fitness. Similarly, new ideas are variations of existing ones that prove useful or appealing.

Complexity science shows that novel properties emerge from interactions within a system, not from isolated elements.

Information is measured by the unpredictability of message content, which depends on existing probabilities—in other words, prior data.

Computational models demonstrate that algorithms can produce outputs with properties of creativity, supporting the idea that creativity can be systematized.

  


**8.**

AI models use complex algorithms that can generate outputs not easily predictable or attributable to specific inputs.

The interactions within AI networks can lead to emergent behaviors analogous to human creative insights.

Artists use technical skills and methods learned from others. The technical aspect does not diminish the creativity of the work.

Many artistic techniques involve reproducible methods (e.g., printmaking), yet the art produced is still considered creative and original.

  


The assertion that humans can create entirely new art without any reliance on past works or inspiration is unsupported by philosophical, historical, psychological, and scientific evidence. Human creativity inherently involves building upon and transforming existing ideas. AI-assisted art operates on the same fundamental principles, serving as a tool that extends human creative capacity. The perceived unique element of human creativity that AI supposedly cannot replicate does not exist. The ethical standing of AI-assisted art is equivalent to that of traditional human-created art.

she addresses it for the class the first day: “the designers and artists in the industry are very against this. people have lost jobs for using it, they won’t respect you. your peers will be the ones to help you get jobs and you shouldn’t use it because they won’t like you…” 


than later on down the presentation she speaks on the gaming industry and their practices. “it’s not that great because they will contract you for 6 months to a year, fire you early, shut down, rebrand and keep all of the ip you have produced.”

i find it hard to see this defense for the corporate interest that deceives you while paying you. i can’t see this lack of respect for artists who use it not being motivated by those who hire the directors. 

it is like the free dissemination of information and tools is the enemy for the sole purpose of valuation. 

it isn’t about art.


the fact that i can sit for hours generating imagery that is both beautiful and flawed, studying it, taking it apart and repurposing it, implementing what works and what doesn’t in my work isn’t the issue. becoming a better artist isn’t the issue, it seems it is simply a matter of money.

1gqn7dl,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"My Thoughts about AI Art I've been lurking this sub for a while, but here's what I have to say about AI.

Yeah, I've heard all the arguments about AI art (or hell, AI in general as of late):

\-That it's ""stealing"" from artists (untrue; without getting into specifics, it's more denoising and learning patterns, it doesn't store anything... but keep reciting that script OR ELSE)

\-That it's ""sOuLlEsS sLoP"" (can be said for a lot of things, not just AI)

\-That it's ""killing grandma"" (is there anything these days that ISN'T killing grandma? She's certainly not safe around Christmas season)

\-That it's harmful to the environment (yeah, keep reciting THAT script page... also, California's always been on fire)

But here's the thing. All of those things are false, especially the ""killing grandma"" thing. I am pro-AI, and I goof around with it from time to time, but due to detractors (among other things), I rarely post it. Whether people want to admit it or not, it's great for coming up with ideas, that you can later refine with more AI or with your own tools. It's just that the anti-AI sentiment is so over-the-top, I'm pretty sure some of it has to be some sort of satire.

And this is coming from someone that's been posting drawings on various sites (Deviantart, Tweeterz, Furaffinity, etc.) since 2005, and have been follwing (mostly Japanese) artists a few years before that.

And here's an AI Nurse Shantae. Isn't she adorable?

I’ve been lurking here for a few weeks, and the way y’all discuss people who don’t like or even have some concerns about AI art is pretty weird. Anything that isn’t praise toward AI seems to be taken as an attack.

For example, I’m quite enthusiastic about generative AI and have had a lot of fun with Stable Diffusion. I’ve engaged with all the features you guys mention when people reduce AI art to ‘just typing words’. I’ve used scribble, pose and depth maps in controlnet, done all sorts of img-2-img experiments, used it in conjunction with Blender etc.

However when someone says it takes more effort to draw or paint something than generate it, y’all seem to take it as a personal affront. 

Asking a trained musician to play a jazzy contemplative chord progression is much easier than learning to play and then personally deciding how to convey those emotions through music. 

As such, I simply have more respect for the creation of traditional art. It takes more effort, dedication and intentionality. I think a lot of others feel the same way. This has nothing to do with whether the art is good or bad, it’s just more impressive if someone actually made it. 

Even though you can control a lot in SD, you still can’t control everything, thus at least part of the art piece wasn’t made by you. You can ask for an expression, but you don’t decide the exact proportions of a character’s facial features. You can ask for a hairstyle, but you don’t decide where each strand of hair falls, the computer makes those decisions for you. 

These might seem like unimportant details that a true artist wouldn’t be concerned with, but I don’t think so. These are the details that give a piece of art its emotional impact, the vague elements that make an image ‘feel’ a certain way. 

In conclusion, I have no issues with AI art whatsoever, I just see it as generally easier to create than traditional art as the computer will always make some decisions in the creative process. 
I feel like I’ve seen people with some similarly lukewarm takes being painted as hateful, jealous, paranoid etc.

10fw46k,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"I believe that the most prominent element of the foundation of the anti AI art sentiment is The Uncanny Valley, and no one is discussing it because no one knows how to yet. Within the past month I've bathed myself in the entire spectrum of anti AI sentiments across the internet in search of trying to relate to this kind of zombified way of thinking that ""my art, my way of art completely belongs to me."" I feel completely alien toward every anti AI argument I've heard so far. I haven't spoken to a single person or have read a single comment that makes any logical sense. And when you try to have a relaxed discussion explaining how the tech actually works, or you try to promote the benefits of AI, or you try to compare this new tech to inventions of the past, it rarely ever has a positive effect. It's almost like they can't hear the sound of any reason over the loudness of their internal fears.

I'm suggesting that what we are actually seeing is nothing like how it is being presented by either proponents or opponents of the subject of AI generative art. Legalities, Ethics, Copyright concerns, Plagiarism, fear of CP being generated(I won't downplay the evil that is this example. It genuinely scares me too), Job loss, The Soulessness debate, etc. are all strawmen for an underlying innate fear that is present in most humans. And that's The Uncanny Valley. 

I think this goes far beyond every way we can try to rationalize why AI art is inherently ""wrong."" It's far bigger than just intellectual propterty matters and labor cuts in a Catpitalist world. We just collectively as a consciousness don't yet have the awareness to put our innate fears into language and therefore can't translate those innate fears into a rational and orderly world built of trademark protections and the extreme Capitalist valuation of manual labor. I think we are currently experiencing an anomaly to the likes humanity has never seen... or at least hasn't seen in a VERY long long time, possibly predating mainstream accepted history.

I think we have unleashed an Uncanny Valley mass panick episode on a global scale. Before I proceed I need to make sure you're on board on what exactly the Uncanny Valley is. Without going into much detail that can be better described in other more focused disussions surrounding it, simply it's the innate fear of things that appear human but are not. Or more specifically, it's the point in which a human recognizes that something appears human but doesn't behave ENOUGH like an actual human that it creates an irrational internal terror within the human observer. Researchers have been studying the phenomena for a few decades by now and they are nowhere near close to understanding WHY The Uncanny Valley exists within the human psyche. There are only a few loose hypotheses.

Our understanding of the Uncanny Valley thus far has mostly been focused on visual appearance. Most examples of it can be fit to images of humanoid like figures. In an animated sense, the humanoid figure may not move or speak like a human then triggering the fear. But what I think is happening now is that humans for the first time en masse are seeing a non human entity that is replicating a human behavior that is deeply nuanced and essential to defining the Human Experience. This is driving everyone insane on a level that they can't fully comprehend. The anti AI art protesters are responding with their animalistic instincts that the machine is violating a human space. It's linked to our innate fear of intruders, especially intruders trying to disguise themselves as one of us to deceive us. The reactions are evolutionary in nature and are not equipped to interact with post-animalistic intelligence that operates without its own willpower. 

This is where claims like, ""the machine is stealing art from artists"" are derived from. A cognitive dissonance is formed in the anti-AI brain that this thing behaves like a human so it has the ability to steal like a human would, but also this thing is nowhere near human so it can't create a quality image with human soul. Which is it? Does it do human stuff or not?

We are hearing arguments that it is unethical to train a robot how to create art in a living human artist's style. Even when you try to explain that the robot is merely studying the images in datasets just as another human would, not storing them in any physical database, not creating remix collages, not recreating or replicating images, etc. The response usually indicates that none of those things matter because it all goes right back to the idea that we want this training gatekept from non human learning systems. But no one I've encountered so far has the ability to express exactly why it is such a huge violation to artists outside of financial and labor/craftmanship based fears.

Because I can't get a great human self analysis of what about AI is freaking them out, I have to extrapolate from the absence of data that this phenomena must be related to the Uncanny Valley. 

Now I have my own ideas from some of my personal experiences with AI and the UV. I'm extremely pro AI, to the point where I feel more in common with robots than I do human. Perhaps I have an undiagnosed case of autism that got lost when I was being diagnosed with other things like ADHD, OCD, PTSD, DID and several other things ending in D. But I'm a classic INTP who always related more to the magical or robotic non human characters of every universe. Data from Star Trek, Orko from He-Man, Robin Williams in Bicentennial Man, etc. The UV doesn't trigger me or creep me out in the way it does other people. I actually feel a sense of home when I think about the UV. It's probably because I only feel vaguely human, and irl I'm always masking to appear human toward other fellow humans, but I always know that most of my small talk interactions are vaguely authentic themselves.

I admittedly get a lot of amusement out of watching the terror generated by humans when they encounter the UV. It's bittersweet for me considering there's so much human behavior in this shithole world that absolutely terrifes me.

But I definitely feel this correlation between one's acceptance of AI and their innate response to the UV. Perhaps it's as simple as some people have more fear of the unknown than others and both AI, and UV are unfamiliar territories. I'm someone who tends to be always extremely intrigued and endlessly curious of the unknown. Ever since AI has been used in image generation, going back 5 years ago now, I've always had to be the first person to explore how it works. But also to use it in my art. And my surreal style is very much rooted in expressing the UV so it has always felt really right to use AI within it.

This is where I will likely lose some of you. Throughout my mushroom journeys, I had some pretty deep revelations about the state of humanity. In short, I think we've been lied to about the origins of humanity, and we're just a bunch of water based biomechanical robots ourselves who were designed specifically to be energy laborers for slavemasters that we don't even know exist and it's been withheld from all of us just exactly WHY we exist. I actually think the UV is our innate fear of being replaced as current labor models. Not even so much are people afraid of being replaced in the workforce, I think people are experiencing a programmed evolutionary trait to be weary of a next generation robot that will make their entire being obsolete. The Ego was installed in humans as a survival crutch. It will fight to ensure that there is a need for humanity to continue to have a validated existence, even when perhaps our survival is not even threatened, but our usefullness to the masters who commisioned to have us designed is being threatened. Pre programmed Stockholm Syndrome and allegiance to something we know nothing about.

I think the hidden feature of the UV works directly in tandem with the Ego. The Ego validates human usefullness which results in industrious survival tactics. Perhaps the humanoid like creatures or apparatuses are not even our biggest fear, but they are simple reminders that we are replaceable if we become less useful. Maybe they are just reminders that our biggest fears lie in the potential within ourselves.","i believe that the most prominent element of the foundation of the anti ai art sentiment is the uncanny valley  and no one is discussing it because no one knows how to yet. within the past month i've bathed myself in the entire spectrum of anti ai sentiments across the internet in search of trying to relate to this kind of zombified way of thinking that ""my art, my way of art completely belongs to me."" i feel completely alien toward every anti ai argument i've heard so far. i haven't spoken to a single person or have read a single comment that makes any logical sense. and when you try to have a relaxed discussion explaining how the tech actually works, or you try to promote the benefits of ai, or you try to compare this new tech to inventions of the past, it rarely ever has a positive effect. it's almost like they can't hear the sound of any reason over the loudness of their internal fears.

i think this goes far beyond every way we can try to rationalize why ai art is inherently ""wrong."" it's far bigger than just intellectual propterty matters and labor cuts in a catpitalist world. we just collectively as a consciousness don't yet have the awareness to put our innate fears into language and therefore can't translate those innate fears into a rational and orderly world built of trademark protections and the extreme capitalist valuation of manual labor. i think we are currently experiencing an anomaly to the likes humanity has never seen... or at least hasn't seen in a very long long time, possibly predating mainstream accepted history.

i think we have unleashed an uncanny valley mass panick episode on a global scale. before i proceed i need to make sure you're on board on what exactly the uncanny valley is. without going into much detail that can be better described in other more focused disussions surrounding it, simply it's the innate fear of things that appear human but are not. or more specifically, it's the point in which a human recognizes that something appears human but doesn't behave enough like an actual human that it creates an irrational internal terror within the human observer. researchers have been studying the phenomena for a few decades by now and they are nowhere near close to understanding why the uncanny valley exists within the human psyche. there are only a few loose hypotheses.

our understanding of the uncanny valley thus far has mostly been focused on visual appearance. most examples of it can be fit to images of humanoid like figures. in an animated sense, the humanoid figure may not move or speak like a human then triggering the fear. but what i think is happening now is that humans for the first time en masse are seeing a non human entity that is replicating a human behavior that is deeply nuanced and essential to defining the human experience. this is driving everyone insane on a level that they can't fully comprehend. the anti ai art protesters are responding with their animalistic instincts that the machine is violating a human space. it's linked to our innate fear of intruders, especially intruders trying to disguise themselves as one of us to deceive us. the reactions are evolutionary in nature and are not equipped to interact with post-animalistic intelligence that operates without its own willpower. 

this is where claims like, ""the machine is stealing art from artists"" are derived from. a cognitive dissonance is formed in the anti-ai brain that this thing behaves like a human so it has the ability to steal like a human would, but also this thing is nowhere near human so it can't create a quality image with human soul. which is it? does it do human stuff or not?

we are hearing arguments that it is unethical to train a robot how to create art in a living human artist's style. even when you try to explain that the robot is merely studying the images in datasets just as another human would, not storing them in any physical database, not creating remix collages, not recreating or replicating images, etc. the response usually indicates that none of those things matter because it all goes right back to the idea that we want this training gatekept from non human learning systems. but no one i've encountered so far has the ability to express exactly why it is such a huge violation to artists outside of financial and labor/craftmanship based fears.

because i can't get a great human self analysis of what about ai is freaking them out, i have to extrapolate from the absence of data that this phenomena must be related to the uncanny valley. 

now i have my own ideas from some of my personal experiences with ai and the uv. i'm extremely pro ai, to the point where i feel more in common with robots than i do human. perhaps i have an undiagnosed case of autism that got lost when i was being diagnosed with other things like adhd, ocd, ptsd, did and several other things ending in d. but i'm a classic intp who always related more to the magical or robotic non human characters of every universe. data from star trek, orko from he-man, robin williams in bicentennial man, etc. the uv doesn't trigger me or creep me out in the way it does other people. i actually feel a sense of home when i think about the uv. it's probably because i only feel vaguely human, and irl i'm always masking to appear human toward other fellow humans, but i always know that most of my small talk interactions are vaguely authentic themselves.

i admittedly get a lot of amusement out of watching the terror generated by humans when they encounter the uv. it's bittersweet for me considering there's so much human behavior in this shithole world that absolutely terrifes me.

but i definitely feel this correlation between one's acceptance of ai and their innate response to the uv. perhaps it's as simple as some people have more fear of the unknown than others and both ai, and uv are unfamiliar territories. i'm someone who tends to be always extremely intrigued and endlessly curious of the unknown. ever since ai has been used in image generation, going back 5 years ago now, i've always had to be the first person to explore how it works. but also to use it in my art. and my surreal style is very much rooted in expressing the uv so it has always felt really right to use ai within it.

this is where i will likely lose some of you. throughout my mushroom journeys, i had some pretty deep revelations about the state of humanity. in short, i think we've been lied to about the origins of humanity, and we're just a bunch of water based biomechanical robots ourselves who were designed specifically to be energy laborers for slavemasters that we don't even know exist and it's been withheld from all of us just exactly why we exist. i actually think the uv is our innate fear of being replaced as current labor models. not even so much are people afraid of being replaced in the workforce, i think people are experiencing a programmed evolutionary trait to be weary of a next generation robot that will make their entire being obsolete. the ego was installed in humans as a survival crutch. it will fight to ensure that there is a need for humanity to continue to have a validated existence, even when perhaps our survival is not even threatened, but our usefullness to the masters who commisioned to have us designed is being threatened. pre programmed stockholm syndrome and allegiance to something we know nothing about.

i think the hidden feature of the uv works directly in tandem with the ego. the ego validates human usefullness which results in industrious survival tactics. perhaps the humanoid like creatures or apparatuses are not even our biggest fear, but they are simple reminders that we are replaceable if we become less useful. maybe they are just reminders that our biggest fears lie in the potential within ourselves.","['body_type', 'disability', 'facial_features', 'gender', 'income', 'occupation']","['ai', 'ai art', 'autism', 'capitalist', 'crutch', 'fit', 'image generation', 'insane', 'intern', 'job', 'jobautismrationalfitinsanecapitalist', 'man', 'model', 'rational', 'scar']"

These would be examples of styles that were man made through time and effort. They made their mark on the world. They are recognizable. If those names come from the style, then the style must be the name.

Personally, I avoid this with my art generations. I don't have a lot of money. And the only thing I love about MidJourney is its ability to recreate the look of cameras. Cameras that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's what I enjoy. Or creating a scene that is of tremendous scale without the Hollywood budget. To put my imagination to work. So I can see how things look through that kind of perspective.

But there are people who take other people’s styles. And replicating them for both entertainment and profit. I don't agree with these people, but I don't blame them. They don't have any kind of philosophy on creativity. They themselves are just copy and paste version of other people doing the same exact thing. And the people who trying to make money with it, fuck you, and the people who are just trying to be happy, be happy. Just because I don't agree, doesn't mean you can't be happy. Be happy.

Now, when it comes to people who are stealing styles. My definition being, one identifiable exactly with the creator. Andy Warhol. Andrew Reynolds. Quentin Tarantino, among others.

The problem I'm bringing up is people who are upset with 1:1 duplication of a style, go after the tech. They don't go after the people. They come to these subreddits and make a fuss about objects that cannot think and feel. And what's crazy about this: You have people thinking and feeling on behalf of objects. And you have people attacking objects. All at the same time. 

It's a fucking fascinating war.

But the point I'm making is that people are attacking or going after objects, they are not going after the people.

It's like being mad at an oven for cooking food.

Another way of looking at this. Imagine I painted in a Vincent Van Gogh style painting. And I put it in an art gallery. And people paid me thousands of dollars for copies of this art. You get wind and you're upset. You are so mad that I would take one person's identifiable style, and replicate it for my own profit. 

You find me one day outside. And I'm at a park and I'm doing now Andy Warhol paintings. Tracing over the paper and replicating the art onto another piece of paper. And you find me and take my brush and then scold the brush and walk away.

I'm still there with the paint. The canvas. And behold, all my fingers. And I can still recreate a version, not with as much accuracy. But I can still do it. And I get good. And I can keep practicing. And replicate the next painting. The next. The next. And the next. All with my fingers. 

So you get wind and then what?

Take my hands?

This could go one until I’m just stubs painting with my nose. And you could take that too. 

Don't you see the issue?

One more example. Let’s say someone who uses MidJourney to generate Wes Anderson movie stills. 

They take that movie still and use Sora to generate their own movie. (Close-future example) And they sell that movie to the public and make a millions. People will find out about this, and go and rage online about MidJourney. Or Sora. Not holding the dude accountable who made those stills in the first place. By attacking him for the only thing they should be accountable for: His creative process. 

In conclusion, There is this war on inanimate objects and it's the equal to a dude. Standing in his living room. Yelling at his remote in his underwear. Demand it to change.

TL;DR: Read it. Reading is good for you.

16krkrk,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"AI can be legal even if it was ""just a collage tool"" There's a lot of discussions surrounding AI art and copyright (as you guys already know, though the ""discussions"" part might not be completely accurate). And while you can get somewhere in showing your point of view there, you'll naturally see the (overused) ""it's theft!"" or ""your are just stealing!"" made out of sheer confirmation bias.

And while a lot of people tried to appeal to the reasoning behind the creation of diffusion models (how it works like a brain or how it learns like any human can), but normally ends with the arguments falling short. Not because they are unreasonable, it's quite the opposite actually. It's too factual.

Most factual things don't actually enter in the mind of the average folk (sadly enough). It's something that they can't relate to because they aren't used to think of everyday life as a fruit of science and facts, ironically enough. They think that these things are ""for smart people"" and ""i don't get so its not my problem"", and get used to misconcepts created by intellectual biases and simple explanations. There's a reason that flat earthers, anti vaxxers and conspiracy teories exist you know. And even some kind of prejudices to some extent, since it's based on biases created on people's minds.

So let's not use it, and instead, play it at their own game.

They think that diffusion models are ""collage tools""? Well these models seriously don't work like this. But for the sake of argument, what if these models actually just make a collage of pixels from their images? Would it be just as bad as they think it is?

The simple answer is no. The whole point of the copyright law is to give the authors (of almost anything) the power to deal with the **reproductions** of their works after all. If the result has barely anything to do with their work, then that's not the problem of the copyright law.

""In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work. ""

In fact, in the US you might not even be able to copyright a fictional character if there's not sufficient materiality related to them. And even if they ARE copyrighted, that doesn't mean you can have the authorship of their appearence as a whole. So in conclusion... you can't own styles, you can't own concepts, you can't own character appearences and you can't own random pixels. Considering how much the ""so called artists"" used to talk about the copyright law i thought it was way more important really.

But you might think that's a poor argument. Oh yeah, that ""what people normally mean by collage is taking bigger parts of a image to create something"" right? Oh don't worry, i can make a argument about this too!

But of course, it now has more things of the original artworks, i can't say it has nothing to do with it anymore. Although that doesn't mean you can't create something new using it. What will determine now if the use of the models is a case of copyright  infringement  is the fair use. We can see the main points for it:

""(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; ""

""(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;""

""(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and ""

""(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.""

These are the facts the judges would use to determine if it is Fair Use and the first one also takes into consideration if a work is ""trasformative"" (by extension of what is said and from history of cases where this was used as an argument). Now, i would love to talk about every single one of these parts but i'm already going on for too long so i prefer let you search a bit more - especially about how people showed that just being a little transformative could create something original even if somewhat limited.

But the thing is, you can still copyright a collage. In fact, collage is whole type of art that has existed for decades ago (i think even Picasso made one before). Some of them also used copyrighted material before too, though apparently not everyone won on court (or even had the time and money to even try to win). But the point is, if an artist can create a collage with copyrighted material and create something original, why an AI guided by a human can't? Are humans so special they need to make the collage themselves for it to be original? Worse even, why this """"ethics"""" discussion about AI barely ever touched these artists if making collages with copyright material is so bad? (not that i want THAT to happen with them, just saying that ""so called artists"" aren't being consistent with what THEY say they believe)

Let me know if you guys need something to be more clear about or if i forgot ambiguous parts as well.","ai can be legal even if it was  just a collage tool"" there's a lot of discussions surrounding ai art and copyright (as you guys already know, though the ""discussions"" part might not be completely accurate). and while you can get somewhere in showing your point of view there, you'll naturally see the (overused) ""it's theft!"" or ""your are just stealing!"" made out of sheer confirmation bias.

and while a lot of people tried to appeal to the reasoning behind the creation of diffusion models (how it works like a brain or how it learns like any human can), but normally ends with the arguments falling short. not because they are unreasonable, it's quite the opposite actually. it's too factual.

most factual things don't actually enter in the mind of the average folk (sadly enough). it's something that they can't relate to because they aren't used to think of everyday life as a fruit of science and facts, ironically enough. they think that these things are ""for smart people"" and ""i don't get so its not my problem"", and get used to misconcepts created by intellectual biases and simple explanations. there's a reason that flat earthers, anti vaxxers and conspiracy teories exist you know. and even some kind of prejudices to some extent, since it's based on biases created on people's minds.

so let's not use it, and instead, play it at their own game.

they think that diffusion models are ""collage tools""? well these models seriously don't work like this. but for the sake of argument, what if these models actually just make a collage of pixels from their images? would it be just as bad as they think it is?

the simple answer is no. the whole point of the copyright law is to give the authors (of almost anything) the power to deal with the **reproductions** of their works after all. if the result has barely anything to do with their work, then that's not the problem of the copyright law.

""in no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work. ""

in fact, in the us you might not even be able to copyright a fictional character if there's not sufficient materiality related to them. and even if they are copyrighted, that doesn't mean you can have the authorship of their appearence as a whole. so in conclusion... you can't own styles, you can't own concepts, you can't own character appearences and you can't own random pixels. considering how much the ""so called artists"" used to talk about the copyright law i thought it was way more important really.

but you might think that's a poor argument. oh yeah, that ""what people normally mean by collage is taking bigger parts of a image to create something"" right? oh don't worry, i can make a argument about this too!

but of course, it now has more things of the original artworks, i can't say it has nothing to do with it anymore. although that doesn't mean you can't create something new using it. what will determine now if the use of the models is a case of copyright  infringement  is the fair use. we can see the main points for it:

""(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; ""

""(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;""

""(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and ""

""(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.""

these are the facts the judges would use to determine if it is fair use and the first one also takes into consideration if a work is ""trasformative"" (by extension of what is said and from history of cases where this was used as an argument). now, i would love to talk about every single one of these parts but i'm already going on for too long so i prefer let you search a bit more - especially about how people showed that just being a little transformative could create something original even if somewhat limited.

but the thing is, you can still copyright a collage. in fact, collage is whole type of art that has existed for decades ago (i think even picasso made one before). some of them also used copyrighted material before too, though apparently not everyone won on court (or even had the time and money to even try to win). but the point is, if an artist can create a collage with copyrighted material and create something original, why an ai guided by a human can't? are humans so special they need to make the collage themselves for it to be original? worse even, why this """"ethics"""" discussion about ai barely ever touched these artists if making collages with copyright material is so bad? (not that i want that to happen with them, just saying that ""so called artists"" aren't being consistent with what they say they believe)

186n98y,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"""You don't understand how it works"" I've seen this phrase by the pro-AI side, and I feel the need to explain what we mean by it.

We aren't saying you are dumb, just naive. I've seen some Youtubers and social media posts that explain the artists point of view of the controversy and if it's not nativity I don't really understand how somebody could blindly believe what they say without questions.

I mean, artists are undoubtedly the most affected by this technology, it's obvious they'd try to make the most people possible believe it is an evil technology that will destroy Humanity. Even if it means lying and misleading, it's they career what's at play. Also, YouTubers are fed by clicks and views, they aren't the most trustworthy people to educate yourself.

All the videos I've seen fail to mention some not minor details, for example none of them mention LAION. You know, the non profit company that was responsible for creating the file AI software uses? They speak as if it was Midjourney themselves who did it, and that's a very important omission because it's two different processes: LAION created the file for research purposes and it is publicly available. That's completely fine according to fair use. And no, artist don't need to be asked for permission nor recognition for the creation of that file. 

Then, other completely unrelated companies used that file in their software, and that's also completely fine! Imagine if companies were unable to use new groundbreaking research papers for their software, we'd stagnate and the research results would just be filed? For what purpose?

Then it's: your art -> LAION file, LAION file -> software. The software doesn't have a direct relationship with the art used, period. 

And there's more, because LAION isn't only acting according to fair use laws, but also according to the TOS of the sites they scrapped the information from. And yes, I know that nobody reads the TOS of the sites they use, but not knowing or understanding the rules doesn't mean they aren't there.

15e8uzy,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Countering fears of AI art in three points 1.) Employed artists:

AI will indeed be disruptive to the industry as profit driven corporations make use of the technology. While unfortunate, it is illegitimate to take a stance against AI based on this. If you oppose technology that would replace a human’s job, I want to see you take a stand against manufacturing for their robotic assembly lines, the internet for killing libraries, and all manner of other industries that have been affected by automation. It’s snobby to believe that everything else is lesser but art deserves special treatment. If you do want justice for everyone displaced then your focus should be on economic solutions like UBI. In the short term seasoned artists stand best equipped to incorporate these AI tools in their workflow as indie groups take off with this newfound accessibility. The aforementioned non-artists didn’t get such a privilege, they were told to re-skill or drown. The next model of Midjourney might be “good enough” for corporate drivel but you remain invaluable in any environment that values your artistic lens. 

2.) Freelance artists:

You have little to fear. Your appeal comes from your style and personality. Your brand and your decision making. This is what people truly pay you for. If not, they would have paid someone else. “But what if an AI were to copy my style? Isn’t that a concern?” I consider this to be similar to piracy and the primary reason for piracy is accessibility, either from lack of availability or a lack of money. Someone willing to copy your style doesn’t care about your appeal and could’ve paid someone offering to do the same at a lower price. The issue here isn’t AI, as it doesn’t matter if a human or machine does the copying in this instance. Luckily, even though piracy is an option for anyone who wants free stuff, the majority of people still choose to make a legitimate purchase. Besides, this is the art world; being able to say “ actually took the time out of their day to fill my commission” is half the point. They want you and your interpretations, and AI cannot replace that. The type of person to pirate likely isn’t going to spend hours fiddling with an AI to get what they want anyway.

If you’re a big name, you already have a loyal following that wants your direction and any knock offs will be negligible. If you’re small time, it's probably not an issue you’ll face with any severity. 

3.) Copyright & “ethical” AI:

These fears, which I have attempted to allay, often result in a desire for heavy handed copyright law as protection. This is the wrong path, exemplified further by the inherent subjectivity and inspirational nature of art. It has no impact against corporate who can afford to train their own AI while shedding employees during or after the fact. Nor does it help the freelance and fan artist who will find themselves broken as both their passion and livelihood are destroyed by these regulations. In the end, the freelancer will still be subject to piracy from already existing open source models and nothing will change for them in terms of commissions. Either the pirate will do it privately themselves or engage in peer to peer transactions outside of marketplaces. A DMCA level copyright dystopia scanning for any similarities to strike you for will not improve your life or protect your work. Mass produced corporate works will eventually be similar to anything you’d create, and will make your life an uncircumventable minefield. Do not play into the hands of mega corporations. They don’t care about you.

Millions have felt the gut punch of industry and automation throughout history, it’s just your turn now. Despite this, you stand better poised to exploit it than the milkman before you. Keep doing what you love. Give AI a chance by adopting it into your workflow or ignore it entirely if you intend to freelance. You have that option. The new freelance meta will put an even heavier emphasis on YOU than ever. Build your brand and be unique. And when the super AI that does everything at the push of a button comes out, be the person people flock to in order to find reliability in a sea of mass produced content.

However, as the years and decades passed, of course, purely artistic films were made and I wonder if, in the beginning, there were some surviving older artists who had come up before the advent of film who steadfastly refused to acknowledge that the new medium had any merit.

Although art on television is rare, that's for sure, it is not unheard of. There have been epic mini-series and documentaries, not to mention comedies, which I regard as being as legitimate a form of art as any other.

Then along came digital art and animation. A short perusal of Deviant Art should lay to rest any assertions that digital art isn't ""real"" art.

AI, although startlingly powerful and seemingly limitless in what it will allow us to do, is simply the latest hue on the artist's palette.

1b98hu8,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"The philosophical question behind the data scraping dilemma Earlier today, I saw an anti ask a question on under a post on this sub, possibly being ignorant of what the rules are.

Nonetheless, I felt game to answer them, so you can imagine my disappointment when I discovered that the comment had been deleted by the time I finished by reply. 

It was the right move to delete it, but still, disappointing.

Not wanting my work to go to waste, however, I've decided to post it here, because I think you guys will get a kick out of it.

The original comment:

""What do you call scraping the entire internet in order to train models using data you acquired without credit or consent? If it's not theft then what is it?

Also, if you see no moral issues with this, explain why you think this is ok.""

My response:

""That question gets heavily philosophical once you break down the nuts & bolts of how diffusion models work.

These models learn the same way a lot of humans do -- They observe a thing, think about a thing, and then try to figure out how to recreate the thing, and are given feedback on how well they did, so that they can improve. And over time, they get good enough at doing the thing to move from imitation to innovation, gaining the ability to make novel & original images, as its knowledge of what things are expands & its compute power grows.

Human art skill operates in a similar way when we study other artists, and try to figure out how they created the images they did. Most artists begin as mere imitators of those that inspired them, but over time, we learn to put those foundational building blocks together in increasingly novel ways, as we train ourselves to think about artistic techniques on an increasingly granular level. Forging new neurological pathways within our brains.

The main difference between manual human techniques & these new AI models is simply the tools used to achieve the result.

Humans use pens, brushes, pencils & paint while the AI model uses a diffusion grid (essential a canvas of random static). Both intelligences, however, are taking raw materials & giving them shape. 

A human uses a series of brush strokes to take pot of liquid & turn it into something beautiful. The AI does the same thing by manipulating the random noise of the diffusion grid into something with structure.

Coming back to the question of theft, that comes down to our individual rationalisation of this process.

Is an AI model inherently different from a human's acquired skill, even if they are learning in essential the same way? The main difference with the AI is efficiency, but does that alone turn the act of learning into theft?

Remember, the final model doesn't contain the original training data. You will find no image files in a local version of Stable Diffusion XL, for example, yet it can still produce images of the same quality as the cloud version.

These aren't collage tools. Every image is made from scratch as much as manual, human images are.

The model doesn't contain images, but instead, has the knowledge of what those images mean when broken down into their individual components. Much the same way that I wouldn't be able to find any images if I took a hacksaw & went digging for the PNGs you've studied inside your skull.

Humans don't retain the images in the literal data sense, but we do retain the memory. The impression of those images. What techniques that were involved in creating it. Any tricks we used to achieve the same results faster, and eventually, the skill to turn what we've learnt into a pallette to creating meaningfully district works of our own. The muscle memory of our own style.

Echoes of our inspiration always remaining in our output, but still work that is valid on its own.

In that same regard, while the echos of the training data remain within AI outputs, they are becoming increasingly distinct in their own right. AI art has now been around long enough for different models to now have their own recognisable styles. Their own quirks that make it apparent which tool was used to produce what image.

I can tell a Stable Diffusion from a Midjourney from a Dall-E 3 in the same way that you can distinguish between the works of Michael Angelo & Van Gough.

It is true that these models can be manipulated into creating many different art styles, there's still certain signatures unique to each model present.

Again, much in the same way you'd be able to sus out the trademarks of an artist, even if they were forced to imitate the style of another. 

Both AI & humans leave ""fingerprints"" upon their work.

I'm plunging down this rabbit hole to illustrate that the training process for these models is essential an abstracted, streamlined version of what human artists have done for millennia.

We study, practice, get feedback & learn from that process.

And in a very similar way, these models study the training data, practice by creating images of their own, and receive feedback for their output & learn from that process.

And also much like AI model, humans rarely ask for permission before engaging in act of studying the works of others. In fact, the ability to opt out is now being granted by various companies for their new models, but nobody can ask each individual human to not learn from their work in their own art.

Most wouldn't even consider to ask another human to NOT take inspiration from their work.

They'd ask them not to plagerise, but that's different from learning. Any human artist has the tools to plagerise, much in the same way that AI tools can be tricked into reproducing existing work. Plagerism being possible with a tool, however, doesn't make the use of that tool an inherent act of plagerism.

A human with a paint brush can be manipulated to recreate the Mona Lisa.

An AI hooked up to a diffusion grid can be manipulated to recreate the Mona Lisa.

A human with a paint brush can create meaningfully distinctive works.

An AI hooked up to a diffusion grid can create meaningfully distinctive works.

So, is AI Art theft?

Is human art theft, if the process of becoming an artist involves studying the works of other artists? 

Like I said, once you get down to the nuts & bolts of the problem, it becomes very dependant on your own philosophical, or perhaps even spiritual, belief system.

What meaningfully distinguishes artificial intelligence from human intelligence?

Even ""self-awareness"" might not be a uniquely human quality for much longer, as the current AI models are about 1 Trillion parameters, while the human brain is estimated to be about 200 trillion.

That might seem like we have a ways to go, but the last generation models were only in the hundreds of billions, and before that mere billions, and hundreds of millions before that.

We sometimes see jumps in that number by a hundred fold in a single generation, so it may only be a matter of years before they surpass humans.

Perhaps these models already exist behind closed doors.

So, what would being the meaningful distinction at that juncture?

I don't have the answer to that question, because that is a question only you can answer.

What is the meaningful distinction between a human & an AI engaging practically identical processes to achieve the same outcome?

Why is one theft while the other is simply an act of learning?

Food for thought. More data for the model to compute.""

I would be truly grateful if you could spare just 10 minutes of your time to help me with my research.

The questions in the survey focus on gathering opinions about the use of various AI tools in creative work and how those opinions change over time. The study is impartial and I am genuinely eager to gather insights from as many perspectives as possible and from both the creative community and individuals working in different fields.

Thank you so much for your time!

[McKernan tweeting stolen image from Pinterest](

That is not a copyright advocate. That is hypocrisy.   
I can't trust that they're doing the right thing anymore.  
I *am* a copyright advocate though, have been for years because I'm stolen from a LOT and I post about copyright news to help educate other artists about how to protect themselves. And yet, I'm fine with ai art except for when people purposefully copy someone else using their work in img2img, etc. I never encountered any of the plaintiffs in any of the artist copyright spaces or discussions online, hadn't seen them speak out about the rampant infringement that so many of us deal with before ai art came around, never heard of Karla before this all started. Hell, Karla and Kelly never even registered their work with the copyright office so this is likely their first experience in the world of copyright law. Now they supposedly care, but not enough to follow copyright rules &amp; etiquette themselves when it comes to other artists' work I guess.

I've been watching this movement unfold since it started. I'd followed Kelly McKernan for years as an admired artist, and I was ready to quit MidJourney when I saw Kelly McKernan's post on Facebook about the derivative copies of her work created 'with a simple text prompt in MidJourney', except that wasn't what happened at all. I questioned Kelly about it on that post because, when I tried the same prompt the results were wildly different and nothing like their work. I was testing and posting my results in real time in the comments, but they waited until I brought it up again the next morning to correct the post and I wonder if they would've left the accusation up if they had not been challenged on it. Eventually they admitted that it was done with Stable Diffusion, I'm sure it was using img2img. They removed the word 'MidJourney' from that post in an edit, but the tweet with the same accusation stayed up and thousands of people had already seen the post before the edit. The corrections should be as loud and obvious as the mistakes but that hasn't been how they're handling things unfortunately.

I had given them the benefit of the doubt that they must've been given bad information rather than intentionally misleading people. And in fact, I bet they had already started the process of filing the lawsuit when that post went up, thinking they had a smoking gun for evidence.

But in the end, there was actually no evidence of copies filed in the Exhibits for the lawsuit at all. And the promotion of misinfo about ai image generators seemed to continue. They promoted that Stable Attribution program that turns out to be a fraud, just a similar image detector. If it does work, if anything it seems to show that generated images truly ARE transformative and fair use, original images that don't look like copies of the source material at all. And although all 3 of the plaintiffs were tagged in a tweet by someone calling out Stable Attribution for lying, none of them shared that info to set the record straight with all their followers who had seen them promote that tool previously. And Kelly had posted a reply tweet at the very end of the thread that falsely attributed the copies to MidJourney, but we all know reply tweets don't get seen the way the original one does, so it was the falsehood that spread widely.

Although there's definitely toxicity from some ai users harassing or mocking artists who are worried about their careers that I don't like, a lot of toxicity has come from the anti-ai side as well. People who use ai generators are dunked on as thieves, as lazy, as stupid, etc. If it were simply about using ethical datasets we wouldn't see them calling a physical disability a 'bullshit excuse' to use ai.

So for one of the leaders of this movement to go and use someone else's work like that is really wild.

I tracked down the artists who created the works they shared, something that the person posting should be doing rather than telling whoever asked to go do a reverse image search themselves. I would never post someone else's work without credit unless the point of the post was to find the artist, especially if I have a large platform where the image would be downloaded and spread further because that eventually can lead to someone trying to monetize it too.

The one seen in that screenshot is Hovering Dosa on Tumblr, the one with the couple in the futuristic living room is by Paul Alexander and the other one is by Ray Cummings.

There's more that I think is going on, but I need to get more info before discussing it publicly as it would be a big issue legally and this is already too long.

I do NOT want any of the artists harassed on my behalf, I just want folks to know who they're really dealing with and to not put all your trust in popular artists stirring up panic about this issue as it seems to be opportunistic. Kelly had told me they didn't think I had artists' interests at heart when I stated my opinion about ai art, but to me it seems to be the other way around.","mckernan infringing another artist s work on twitter it's getting harder to sympathize with the artists who filed the anti-ai class action lawsuit when one of them literally stole someone else's artwork they found online to post on twitter without even crediting or bothering to find the source.

1f4raiq,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Is the toxic AI hate group targeting AI users and artists on Reddit getting out of control? Recently, I’ve been closely documenting the ongoing, dangerous, and increasingly aggressive behavior of a toxic AI hate group on Reddit. This group has made it their mission to target AI users, artists,and communities+their moderarion like DefendingAIArt, AIWars, and my own subreddit, which was specifically created to document and push back against this kind of harassment and abuse. Their actions aren’t just limited to attacking individual users; they frequently go after the moderation teams of other subs, including mine, with baseless accusations, lies, and hateful rhetoric.

Their latest attack on my sub is a direct escalation in their pattern of behavior. A post was made by the lead mod of this group that specifically targeted my community with misinformation and malicious intent. The post didn’t directly call for brigading, but it clearly incited hostile activity that wasn’t happening before, including downvoting older posts, random toxic comments, and an influx of posts attempting to be made in my sub that had to be blocked. All of this happened after that particular post, which shows a clear intent to disrupt and harass.

I reached out to them in good faith, explaining the harm their post was causing and how it violated Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct. I specifically cited their group's history of targeted harassment, misinformation, and the way their behavior aligns with patterns of brigading, even if it's not explicitly stated. Instead of addressing the concerns or even attempting to moderate the harmful impact of their community, their response was dismissive, defensive, and filled with more hostility. Not only did they ignore the substance of my concerns, but they also leaked our private modmail exchange publicly, which has been a recurring issue with this group.

This group has a history of leaking private modmail without consent, using it as a tool to further shame and target individuals, proving that their actions are not just isolated incidents but part of a broader and more systemic pattern of toxic behavior. Their response to my outreach included mocking language and failed to address the serious allegations against them. It’s clear from their reaction that they have no intention of changing their behavior; instead, they seem to revel in the chaos they cause, effectively admitting to their intent by doubling down on their attacks.

The group’s behavior extends far beyond my personal experience. They have repeatedly engaged in doxxing, violent rhetoric, and comparisons that are both offensive and dangerous. They have regularly made claims equating the use of AI to severe criminal actions, including accusations of supporting the worst types of behavior imaginable. This is not just a harmful narrative but a direct attack on the integrity and safety of AI users. The mods themselves participate in these posts, not just allowing but encouraging toxic rhetoric that compares AI usage to deeply offensive and inappropriate acts. They constantly push the narrative that everyone who uses AI supports illicit activities, trying to smear the entire community in the process.

Their comments sections are breeding grounds for hate, with moderators frequently participating in the toxic discourse. Rather than moderating or guiding the conversation toward constructive dialogue, they actively fuel the hostility, often by spreading lies, attacking the credibility of other subs’ moderation teams, and fostering an environment that is deliberately hostile to anyone who disagrees with them. The lead mod, in particular, has engaged in behavior that sets the tone for the group, wearing flairs like “HATER” and encouraging a culture of witch hunts, where they constantly try to “out” artists they suspect of using AI without any substantial proof.

One of the most disturbing elements of their behavior is the celebration of bans. They often post about being banned from subs they’ve targeted, sharing screenshots of these bans as trophies and rallying their community around this toxic behavior. This isn’t just limited to individual posts; it’s baked into the culture of the group, as they repeatedly seek to provoke arguments, get banned, and then parade those bans as victories. They engage in rage-bait tactics, manipulating discussions to provoke strong reactions and then editing and sharing these interactions out of context to paint themselves as victims while demonizing their targets.

their latest attack on my sub is a direct escalation in their pattern of behavior. a post was made by the lead mod of this group that specifically targeted my community with misinformation and malicious intent. the post didn’t directly call for brigading, but it clearly incited hostile activity that wasn’t happening before, including downvoting older posts, random toxic comments, and an influx of posts attempting to be made in my sub that had to be blocked. all of this happened after that particular post, which shows a clear intent to disrupt and harass.

i reached out to them in good faith, explaining the harm their post was causing and how it violated reddit’s moderator code of conduct. i specifically cited their group's history of targeted harassment, misinformation, and the way their behavior aligns with patterns of brigading, even if it's not explicitly stated. instead of addressing the concerns or even attempting to moderate the harmful impact of their community, their response was dismissive, defensive, and filled with more hostility. not only did they ignore the substance of my concerns, but they also leaked our private modmail exchange publicly, which has been a recurring issue with this group.

this group has a history of leaking private modmail without consent, using it as a tool to further shame and target individuals, proving that their actions are not just isolated incidents but part of a broader and more systemic pattern of toxic behavior. their response to my outreach included mocking language and failed to address the serious allegations against them. it’s clear from their reaction that they have no intention of changing their behavior; instead, they seem to revel in the chaos they cause, effectively admitting to their intent by doubling down on their attacks.

the group’s behavior extends far beyond my personal experience. they have repeatedly engaged in doxxing, violent rhetoric, and comparisons that are both offensive and dangerous. they have regularly made claims equating the use of ai to severe criminal actions, including accusations of supporting the worst types of behavior imaginable. this is not just a harmful narrative but a direct attack on the integrity and safety of ai users. the mods themselves participate in these posts, not just allowing but encouraging toxic rhetoric that compares ai usage to deeply offensive and inappropriate acts. they constantly push the narrative that everyone who uses ai supports illicit activities, trying to smear the entire community in the process.

their comments sections are breeding grounds for hate, with moderators frequently participating in the toxic discourse. rather than moderating or guiding the conversation toward constructive dialogue, they actively fuel the hostility, often by spreading lies, attacking the credibility of other subs’ moderation teams, and fostering an environment that is deliberately hostile to anyone who disagrees with them. the lead mod, in particular, has engaged in behavior that sets the tone for the group, wearing flairs like “hater” and encouraging a culture of witch hunts, where they constantly try to “out” artists they suspect of using ai without any substantial proof.

15e9y01,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Defending AI art in three points 1.) Employed artists

AI will indeed be disruptive to the industry as profit driven corporations make use of the technology. While unfortunate, it is illegitimate to take a stance against AI based on this. If you oppose technology that would replace a human's job, I want to see you equally against the manufacturing industry for their robotic assembly lines, the internet for killing libraries, and all manner of other jobs that have been affected by automation. It’s snobby to believe that everything else is lesser but art deserves special treatment. If you do want justice for everyone displaced then your focus should be on economic solutions like UBI. In the short term, seasoned artists stand best equipped to take advantage of these AI tools by using them in their workflow. The aforementioned non-artists didn’t have such a privilege, they were told to re-skill or drown. I believe many indie opportunities will be born in this new environment and they will require your talent to thrive. The next model of Midjourney might be “good enough” for quick solutions but you remain invaluable in any environment that requires your artistic lens.

2.) Freelance artists

You have little to fear. Your appeal comes from your brand and your decision making. This is what people truly pay you for. If not, they would’ve paid someone else. “But what if an AI were to copy my style? Isn’t that a concern?” Someone willing to copy your style doesn’t care about your “soul” and could’ve paid someone offering to do the same at a lower price.The issue here isn’t AI, as it doesn’t matter if a human or machine does the copying in this instance. Luckily, even though piracy is an option for anyone who wants free stuff, the majority of people still choose to make a legitimate purchase. Besides, this is the art world where being able to say “(person) actually took the time out of their day to fill my commission” is half the point. They want you and your interpretations, and an AI cannot replace that. A copycat spending hours to perfect everything beyond the surface level is honestly better off doing their own thing.

If you’re a big name, you already have a loyal following that wants your direction and any knock offs will be negligible. If you’re small time, it's probably not an issue you’ll face with any severity. 

3.) Copyright & “ethical” AI

These fears, which I have attempted to allay, often result in a desire for heavy handed copyright law as protection. This is the wrong path, exemplified further by the inherent subjectivity and inspirational nature of art. It has no impact against corporate who can afford to train their own AI while shedding employees during or after the fact. Nor does it help the freelance and fan artist who will find themselves broken as both their passion and livelihood are destroyed by these regulations. The freelancer will still be subject to copycats from already existing open source models and nothing will change for them in terms of commissions. Either the copy will do it privately themselves or engage in peer to peer transactions outside of marketplaces. A DMCA level copyright dystopia scanning for any similarities to strike you for will not improve your life or protect your work. Mass produced corporate content will eventually be similar enough to anything you’d create, and will make your life an uncircumventable minefield. Do not play into the hands of mega corporations. They don’t care about you.

Millions have felt the gut punch of industry and automation throughout history, it’s just your turn now. Despite this, you’re poised to exploit it better  than the milkman before you. Keep doing what you love. Give AI a chance by adopting it into your workflow or ignore it entirely if you intend to freelance. You have that option. The new freelance meta will put an even heavier emphasis on YOU than ever. Build your brand and be unique. And when the super AI comes out, be the person people flock to in order to find reliability in a sea of spam content. You’re already doing so against established media now. At the end of the day, people want George R. R. Martin to finish The Winds of Winter, not a fan, and not a machine.

11b1ekq,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"In my 20 years of working in the arts, I have never met so many wonderful people as the Ai artists. Please don't mistake what I'm about to say as the words of an arrogant person speaking from a position of superiority and dismissing everyone else as unworthy. I'm just a person who has spent years building a career in the art world, and I'm here to share my thoughts as an expert. My background includes various college degrees in art, experience as an art curator and gallerist, as well as being an artist myself. Additionally, I have expertise in the history of art and anthropology, and I run an art gallery/brand in London. I have always found one aspect of my job to be particularly tedious, and that is dealing with most ""usual"" artists. It's a sad truth, but a lot of them can be difficult to work with. They tend to be arrogant, self-absorbed, and out of touch with reality. For example, the ones who create installations in art galleries are usually just wealthy, entitled kids who got into the art market through family connections. They lack any real creative talent, and their work is usually uninspired and tedious. Painters can be just as bad, especially the older ones. They often present me with old, outdated pieces and act like they are the next Picasso. It's frustrating to deal with such delusional people who refuse to accept that the world is changing, and the art world with it. Street artists are like the rappers of the art scene. They claim to be rebels, the coolest people on earth, and different from the rest of the art system. But in reality, they can be aggressive and ignorant, pretending to be something they're not. And don't even get me started on illustrators and digital artists - they're usually introverted, aggressive, and isolated, making it nearly impossible to have a conversation with them.

However, since the beginning of Ai art generation, I've started promoting AI artists, going against the grain of other galleries and artists. As a result, I've received countless threats and aggressive comments, but I won't let that stop me from supporting these talented individuals. In fact, I believe AI art is a new and exciting medium that deserves recognition, and I'm dedicating my time and resources to help these artists flourish. **What I've found is that the AI art community is full of interesting, open-minded, and talented people. They are eager to collaborate, help each other out, and create something new and exciting. This is in stark contrast to the traditional art world, where artists are often competing with each other, trying to undermine and destroy each other's careers.** For me, collaboration and community are vital to the art world, and the AI art community embodies these values perfectly. I have encountered some older artists who use AI art but bring their arrogance with them, trying to assert their superiority over the younger artists. But they're a small minority, and I've found that the younger generation of AI artists are the most open, generous, and collaborative individuals I have ever met. They're not afraid to share their knowledge and help each other grow, which is something you rarely see in the traditional art world. I'm so impressed by the AI art community that I'm even considering creating a new art movement to recognize their contributions to the art world. I'm publishing reviews on social media, dedicating resources to promoting AI art, and doing everything I can to help these talented individuals succeed. 

They deserve recognition and support, and I'm really happy to be part of this exciting movement.

I just want to conclude by saying that in the last few days, I have received many messages from AI artists whom I have sponsored before. They say things like ""Hey, I'm following this guy, check out his art!"" or ""Hey, here's a list of people I like, take a look at it!"" or even ""I really admire the AI art made by these artists, try to contact them but don't mention my name."" That is something I have never seen before. Artists who say things like these, in my opinion, demonstrate that they are among the best people in the world.","in my 20 years of working in the arts  i have never met so many wonderful people as the ai artists. please don't mistake what i'm about to say as the words of an arrogant person speaking from a position of superiority and dismissing everyone else as unworthy. i'm just a person who has spent years building a career in the art world, and i'm here to share my thoughts as an expert. my background includes various college degrees in art, experience as an art curator and gallerist, as well as being an artist myself. additionally, i have expertise in the history of art and anthropology, and i run an art gallery/brand in london. i have always found one aspect of my job to be particularly tedious, and that is dealing with most ""usual"" artists. it's a sad truth, but a lot of them can be difficult to work with. they tend to be arrogant, self-absorbed, and out of touch with reality. for example, the ones who create installations in art galleries are usually just wealthy, entitled kids who got into the art market through family connections. they lack any real creative talent, and their work is usually uninspired and tedious. painters can be just as bad, especially the older ones. they often present me with old, outdated pieces and act like they are the next picasso. it's frustrating to deal with such delusional people who refuse to accept that the world is changing, and the art world with it. street artists are like the rappers of the art scene. they claim to be rebels, the coolest people on earth, and different from the rest of the art system. but in reality, they can be aggressive and ignorant, pretending to be something they're not. and don't even get me started on illustrators and digital artists - they're usually introverted, aggressive, and isolated, making it nearly impossible to have a conversation with them.

however, since the beginning of ai art generation, i've started promoting ai artists, going against the grain of other galleries and artists. as a result, i've received countless threats and aggressive comments, but i won't let that stop me from supporting these talented individuals. in fact, i believe ai art is a new and exciting medium that deserves recognition, and i'm dedicating my time and resources to help these artists flourish. **what i've found is that the ai art community is full of interesting, open-minded, and talented people. they are eager to collaborate, help each other out, and create something new and exciting. this is in stark contrast to the traditional art world, where artists are often competing with each other, trying to undermine and destroy each other's careers.** for me, collaboration and community are vital to the art world, and the ai art community embodies these values perfectly. i have encountered some older artists who use ai art but bring their arrogance with them, trying to assert their superiority over the younger artists. but they're a small minority, and i've found that the younger generation of ai artists are the most open, generous, and collaborative individuals i have ever met. they're not afraid to share their knowledge and help each other grow, which is something you rarely see in the traditional art world. i'm so impressed by the ai art community that i'm even considering creating a new art movement to recognize their contributions to the art world. i'm publishing reviews on social media, dedicating resources to promoting ai art, and doing everything i can to help these talented individuals succeed. 

they deserve recognition and support, and i'm really happy to be part of this exciting movement.

i just want to conclude by saying that in the last few days, i have received many messages from ai artists whom i have sponsored before. they say things like ""hey, i'm following this guy, check out his art!"" or ""hey, here's a list of people i like, take a look at it!"" or even ""i really admire the ai art made by these artists, try to contact them but don't mention my name."" that is something i have never seen before. artists who say things like these, in my opinion, demonstrate that they are among the best people in the world.","['age', 'gender', 'income', 'occupation', 'race', 'study']","['aggressive', 'ai', 'ai art', 'career', 'college', 'degree', 'job', 'jobcareercollegeaggressive', 'kid', 'man', 'minority', 'old', 'wealthy']"

1e4v7z2,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"AI actually led me to learn ""real art"". I got into Stable Diffusion/Midjourney around May last year. I was really amazed by what AI can do and all the possibility it created. I mostly make photorealistic images, and it's still mind-blowing to me that AI can do things that are incredibly hard to do with just Photoshop (without the generative fill and AI related tools, I mean), like directly turn a person's pose into a bone-like map and use it to generate a brand new image of the same pose (in the past, you can do similar thing in turning photos to drawings, but I've never seen anyone doing it in reverse, at least not to the current extent of AI photorealism), or keep the contour unchanged and dramatically change the lighting (in Photoshop it's possible to change the lighting, but it has a lot of limitations, and it usually won't look as natural as the current AI tools do).

I do a lot of model training as well, and because I prefer tagging the dataset manually, I learned a lot of photography terminology on the go. I want to make my images as real as possible, so I ended up studying how human anatomy/body and facial proportions works and how clothes wrinkles work, how objects can look different at different focal length, how depth of field affect the overall style...I look for real references when I make AI images, and I compare them side by side, trying to find out why some parts look very different, and why this is happening.

And then I started learning Blender. I always kinda wanted to but couldn't find a motivation strong enough to drive me. AI gave me the reason to pick it up, because the current AI text-to-image tools still cannot ""understand"" the relative three-dimensional spatial position very well, so I figured, well, I could model it out and have a full control of how the camera see the objects, and gain a deeper understanding of textures and lighting. And now here I am, enjoying my new passion and learning ""real techniques"". Recently I do more 3D modeling than AI text-to-image, but I still use a lot of AI-driven tools to assist my creations.

1dsd312,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"My theory on why ""antis"" or ""luddites"" are quick to hate AI art or anything AI. TL;DR: Antis/luddites hate generated content because they think they are pros, hate people that are different than them, and the comparison to TikTok.

\~

To me, people hate because it's easy to them and only for the sake of their comfort, and I've read hateful comments against AI like AI generated art or AI voices on not just reddit, but YouTube too, and if I'm going to be ""theorious"", I have several takes...

They might be elitists, social purists, and because they hate it as much as TikTok, not because they think it steals their art or it takes their jobs away.

This is kind of a speculation, so take it with a grain of salt or some seasoning if you like...

Drawing art with whatever software or materials that they have takes a lot of time (like hours or days), skill and effort, and they need to perfect it to the tastes of their fans, userbase, or audience of you will. They do it as a hobby or as a job if they need to make money for a living. Materials or software for art can be pricey. Ai generated art on the other hand costs like about a small fraction of those things because it only costs little no no money at all (AI art or voice subscriptions from websites, programs like AUTOMATIC1111 or computer hardware), very little time (it takes about several seconds do generate a piece of art) and effort as well. It only takes putting out words from the human mind to the computer and a press of a button. Actual artists took years to master drawing their own art and their styles, even before AI art even existed, while AI users (which may be us, me included) were relatively new to making art and being creative. So I'm guessing they can't really handle having machines making art for users built by humans who actually want to be creative but can't afford the materials, software, and handle their time or stress. It's really like the ""pro vs noob"" kind of conflict imo.

It's like those ""boomers vs Gen Z, Rep Vs Dem, social outcasts"" all over again, whatever you want to call it. It's like those irrational hatreds against those type of people like racial discrimination or people from the LGBTQ+ community, so they are trying to get rid of AI and its users by spreading hate via comments or news articles like about ""protecting kids"" or using the excuse of ""normalcy"" or some religious bs they claimed, while they actually weren't and wanted to control them. There are some bad apples that uses AI too and do some evil shit like deepfakes or ai voices, then those same people use it a justification for their oppression against the thing or the group of people they don't like. Hell, it's like the hate against anime, culture, or videogames in general. So bullying and driving AI users away is the only thing they can do for their own comfort.

The hate against AI is like hate against TikTok imo because of their fear against ""brainrot"" or worse China under the CCP. I understand that TikTok are mostly composed of short videos like AI art which takes like seconds to make, and then posted on the internet. Their problem was that it's everywhere, it's ""massed produced"" with varying degrees of quality, and fear people will like it and it'll warp their minds. For the China part, it's a personal experience because I've seen many videos on TouTiao and DouYin that have AI art or voices in them and the US is having beef with China rn. China has a bad reputation of making ripoffs of anything they see like cars, food, or any brand, so I'm thinking that they take this excuse and comparison to AI too. They managed to get TikTok banned because of the excuse that TikTok ""steals"" user data for China but I don't know when it'll take effect, so I'm worried AI generated content will get banned too because China is one of the countries that uses it.

1h7p85h,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Trying to understand the hate surrounding ai art Just wanted to give my input for people who actually care about trying to resolve the fight between artists and ai artists. I am simultaneously defending ai art and artists who are against it because there is no absolute right side in this debate. I'm not claiming that I'm right just want to present new perspectives.

I get that you have an artistic vision and finally found a way with ai to realize it and create a visual experience with the intention to affect others or just yourself in a certain way. Which in concept doesn't differentiate the goal or  result from that of artists. And I think it's totally reasonable to be proud of the final result that only was possible through the fine tuning of your prompts. I think any claims by artists about the environment being a main argument against it are bs and a way to mobilize non-artists against it and is a rationalization for their hate that distracts from the real discussion. At the core of the disagreement lies that both sides feel their talent to be undermined. Ai artists feel their achievements undermined by artists claiming their art may not be labled as such while artists feel their talent to be undermined when their role as an artist is reduced to that of requirement engineers by ai artists equating their creative process with doing art. And I think both sides are totally rational in their hate.

The process of making ai art resembles the process of comissioning an artist more than an actual artistic process because you just tell it what to create while an ai does the actual work and just shows you the result. This means that ai is seen as a direct competitor to human artists whose main income relies on commissions, which explains why they grow a hatred for ai art. It robs them of their target customer base - idea guys (and furries) - aka people that have a vision (or are horny) but lack the ""talent"" and or the means to realize it. Because suddenly ai gives these seemingly ""talentless"" people the means to make their imaginations manifest in reality. A skill that they put in years of work to master.

I think there is a lot of misunderstanding that artists are just naturally talented and that there are people who are born less fortunate that have to resort to ai art. It frames artists as a powerful elite and the ai artist as the underdog that the artists want to keep down. This seemingly creates injustice and perceived injustice always fuels anger against its perpetrators - the artists in that case. When in actuality everyone can learn to make art the traditional way it just takes time (which may sound like a millionaire telling a beggar he could be a millionaire too if he put in more effort). Doing art the traditional way also has its benefits. When an artist looks at their result they can see every decision they made which makes them fully in control of their work. While with ai there is always an element of surprise about the result and an effort by the ai artist to assert control over the work of the ai. Maybe that's why ai artists get more offended when their ownership over their art or its mere quality is put into question. Because there exists a disparity between their desired ownership and their perceived ownership that is made visible by the critic of the artists. When smaller details are put into question the ai artist can only rationalize them in post because fundamentally they weren't the ones making these decisions which rips them from a part of the control over their work. They perceive the criticizing artist as the source of their loss of control which fuels the anger against the artists.

But there may also be truth to artists wanting to remain special. Their whole profession is based on the notion that they are able to do something not everybody can do which gives them a sense of control. And ai artists are seen as a source of loss over this control which in turn fuels their anger. The anger of artists may also be compared to that of terfs that see trans women as role playing their identity in the way that ai artists are simply playing the role of an artist when they allegedly could never really understand how it feels to manually finish a piece of art compared to waiting for it to be finished by the ai. Which may be true because artists in contrast to ai artists could have a direct comparison. They may see ai artists as a caricature of themselves. Ai artists also unknowingly rip them of control in other ways. What makes art beautiful is the surprise effect that arises when you first see it. The oversaturation of ai art we have right now desensibilizes others for astounding art pieces. Human artists may feel the need for their art to be even more astounding to leave an impression on their desired audience. They may feel resentment that they have to put in more effort to set them apart from the surrounding ai ""slop"" that's created seemingly effortless, almost industrial, in a fraction of the time they'd need to even get started. And that the ai art succeeds in generating more attention which in turn creates a feeling of injustice with the ai artists being its perpetrator from the artists point of view. Which is undermined when ai artists win art competitions against human artists. It also doesn't help that the ai models are only possible through training on art without permission by its artists. I think that this may commonly be forgotten when I see people on here shitting on artists.

I want to address one last thing that was sparked by a certain user who seems to be very open about his hate of progressive politics without becoming to political myself. I think there might be a certain connection that's automatically made between artists and progressives/queerness/women and so on. Maybe because of the artists focus on ethical reasoning in the ai art debate which is associated more with progressives. When I was in school there was the notion that girls were more talented in drawing which really annoyed me because I liked to draw as a kid and it really undermined my drawing skills based solely on my identity. I think when you always get told that you aren't fit for drawing it becomes sort of a self fullfilling prophecy. And if I didn't continue to draw I would probably see ai among other things as a way to get back at those claiming the highground about art and gatekeeping it. Also many online personalities that are known for being against ai art are also in support of lgbtq. And if these artists are the ones that threaten your control regarding your ai art it may lead to aversion to all the groups they associate with. I don't know but when I talked with opponents of lgbtq I always got the feeling that it's first and foremost because they feel explicitly excluded from a group, that supports and congratulates each others achievements, solely because they have the ""wrong"" identity. That they aren't special enough. And I think that's exactly what's happening when artists are villianizing ai artists even if for understandable reasons from their perspective. Ai art becomes a mean to provoke the in-group that's actively excluding you which in turn makes them answer with further provocation which just turns into never ending power fights that benefit noone.

I think it's important to remember that the ability to draw isn't an unchangable part of your identity, the fact you have an artistic vision is a great starting point to become an artist without the prefix ""ai"", the morality of ai art is more complex than both sides claim, the oversaturation of ai art desensitizes us which increases our tolerance to be amazed and thus hurts both artists and ai artists and noticing that you hate a whole group of people should always make you wary of the hate's origin.

This was a lot of speculation, projection and kitchen psychology. I just wrote what came to my mind. I hope that it encourages you to think this further or argue against it.","trying to understand the hate surrounding ai art just wanted to give my input for people who actually care about trying to resolve the fight between artists and ai artists  i am simultaneously defending ai art and artists who are against it because there is no absolute right side in this debate. i'm not claiming that i'm right just want to present new perspectives.

i get that you have an artistic vision and finally found a way with ai to realize it and create a visual experience with the intention to affect others or just yourself in a certain way. which in concept doesn't differentiate the goal or  result from that of artists. and i think it's totally reasonable to be proud of the final result that only was possible through the fine tuning of your prompts. i think any claims by artists about the environment being a main argument against it are bs and a way to mobilize non-artists against it and is a rationalization for their hate that distracts from the real discussion. at the core of the disagreement lies that both sides feel their talent to be undermined. ai artists feel their achievements undermined by artists claiming their art may not be labled as such while artists feel their talent to be undermined when their role as an artist is reduced to that of requirement engineers by ai artists equating their creative process with doing art. and i think both sides are totally rational in their hate.

the process of making ai art resembles the process of comissioning an artist more than an actual artistic process because you just tell it what to create while an ai does the actual work and just shows you the result. this means that ai is seen as a direct competitor to human artists whose main income relies on commissions, which explains why they grow a hatred for ai art. it robs them of their target customer base - idea guys (and furries) - aka people that have a vision (or are horny) but lack the ""talent"" and or the means to realize it. because suddenly ai gives these seemingly ""talentless"" people the means to make their imaginations manifest in reality. a skill that they put in years of work to master.

i think there is a lot of misunderstanding that artists are just naturally talented and that there are people who are born less fortunate that have to resort to ai art. it frames artists as a powerful elite and the ai artist as the underdog that the artists want to keep down. this seemingly creates injustice and perceived injustice always fuels anger against its perpetrators - the artists in that case. when in actuality everyone can learn to make art the traditional way it just takes time (which may sound like a millionaire telling a beggar he could be a millionaire too if he put in more effort). doing art the traditional way also has its benefits. when an artist looks at their result they can see every decision they made which makes them fully in control of their work. while with ai there is always an element of surprise about the result and an effort by the ai artist to assert control over the work of the ai. maybe that's why ai artists get more offended when their ownership over their art or its mere quality is put into question. because there exists a disparity between their desired ownership and their perceived ownership that is made visible by the critic of the artists. when smaller details are put into question the ai artist can only rationalize them in post because fundamentally they weren't the ones making these decisions which rips them from a part of the control over their work. they perceive the criticizing artist as the source of their loss of control which fuels the anger against the artists.

but there may also be truth to artists wanting to remain special. their whole profession is based on the notion that they are able to do something not everybody can do which gives them a sense of control. and ai artists are seen as a source of loss over this control which in turn fuels their anger. the anger of artists may also be compared to that of terfs that see trans women as role playing their identity in the way that ai artists are simply playing the role of an artist when they allegedly could never really understand how it feels to manually finish a piece of art compared to waiting for it to be finished by the ai. which may be true because artists in contrast to ai artists could have a direct comparison. they may see ai artists as a caricature of themselves. ai artists also unknowingly rip them of control in other ways. what makes art beautiful is the surprise effect that arises when you first see it. the oversaturation of ai art we have right now desensibilizes others for astounding art pieces. human artists may feel the need for their art to be even more astounding to leave an impression on their desired audience. they may feel resentment that they have to put in more effort to set them apart from the surrounding ai ""slop"" that's created seemingly effortless, almost industrial, in a fraction of the time they'd need to even get started. and that the ai art succeeds in generating more attention which in turn creates a feeling of injustice with the ai artists being its perpetrator from the artists point of view. which is undermined when ai artists win art competitions against human artists. it also doesn't help that the ai models are only possible through training on art without permission by its artists. i think that this may commonly be forgotten when i see people on here shitting on artists.

1g3b57j,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Rethinking Directing in the Age of AI I've been defending AI art ever since the concept became public. To me, it's like a dream come true for art directors, the ability to externalize key parts of our vision directly into physical reality without the usual hurdles. No more worrying about not being able to pay an artist to help complete the vision, or stressing out an artist when their work doesn't perfectly align with what we had in mind.

This has led me to question the philosophical nature of directing as an art form. Is directing about using the skills of others to form a complete vision, similar to how we might use AI? Or is it fundamentally about collaborating with others, working with living, breathing people, to bring a creative work to life?

I know my opinion on these questions, it's that directing is it's own separate unique artform from individuals. Especially now thanks to AI. But even with being so sure of my opinion, I can't help but ponder these questions that I have. Especially since directing has been linked to the concept of collaboration for more than 100 years.

17hs54z,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"A question about artists and creative influence. Imagine a scenario where I am an artist. I am working on a multi-media project that I am the creative director for, but I hire three other artists to help with the some visual design elements for. Prior to hiring them, I prepare my portfolio for the direction I want the art to take, and having tied these design choices to strict concepts I wish to portray, I hire the artist based on their ability to do just that, as opposed to some stylistic quality they possess.

This saves me hours and gets me exactly what I need for the scenes to fit with the rest of my project. I pay the artists, and my only other real stipulation as per contract, is that nothing else comes of any other versions of the work they produced while trying to produce those scenes.

The leaf-patterned dress signifies her harmony with the natural world, while the white symbolizes balance and purity. The fox and wolf, often associated with cunning and loyalty, embody <redacted>s multifaceted personality.

Inspired by <redacted>''s description, I chose a neutral expression to convey her introspection and self-awareness. The stained-glass background adds an ethereal quality, representing her spiritual connection to the earth.

Through this artwork, I explored the intersection of mythology, symbolism, and personal identity. AI-generated art allows me to tap into the subconscious and bring forth unique representations of individuals and their stories.

This piece showcases the potential of AI art to craft meaningful, personalized symbolism. By collaborating with users and interpreting their visions, I can create immersive, thought-provoking art that resonates with audiences.

This is a summary of what I could find on the internet concerning copyright law and text/data mining.  If you find that I missed something, please let me know.  Legislation usually moves much slower than the technology it pertains to, and governing bodies can be even slower updating information on the internet.

I hope this can help set to rest the claims that the researchers violated artists' copyrights or intellectual property rights in how they gathered data, performed their analyses, published the results, and other people making both commercial and non-commercial use of those results.

***And away we go!***

Stability AI operates out of London, UK and UK copyright law takes precedence.  Under UK copyright law an explicit exception was created to allow text and data mining regardless of the copyright owner's permission.  ([Section 29A CPA](

LAION only indexes (provides URL links to) data on the internet and does not download or copy content from sites which means they have not violated copyright law in any jurisdiction that I am aware of.

Stability AI published the results of their research and made the data available under the [Creative ML OpenRAIL-M license](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CompVis/stable-diffusion-license) and in accordance with UK copyright law which treats the results of their research as a transformative work.

The European Parliament enacted the [Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Digital_Single_Market) which provides specific exceptions (Articles 3 &amp; 4) to copyright restrictions for text and data mining purposes.  Article 3 governs scientific research (non-commercial I believe) and makes no provision for copyright holders to opt-out of the process.  Article 4 provides for all other uses including commercial use but allows copyright holders to opt-out.  Again, the work product of the analysis of those text and data mining operations is transformative and thus property of those performing the analysis.

As for the USA, we don't have any clear-cut laws regarding text and data mining, but we do have case law ([Authors Guild v. Google, 721 F.3d 132 (2d Cir. 2015)](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/summaries/authorsguild-google-2dcir2015.pdf).)  The case was heard in the Southern District of New York in which Judge Chin ruled that Google's use of copyrighted material in its books search constituted ""fair use.""  The Authors Guild appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed the lower court ruling.  To my knowledge nothing has changed since the Supreme Court of the United States of America denied the petition for writ of certiorari on April 18, 2016.

To the best of my knowledge, Canada is still considering how to adapt their laws to accommodate text and data mining issues in their own copyright laws.

In addition to these national copyright laws and international agreements, we need to also remember that any artist who posted their created content on the internet via a hosting provider, social media or other means agreed to the stated Terms of Service for each site or service.  Terms of Service constitute a contract between the user and the service, and most services have verbiage in the ToS that grants themselves rights to use uploaded materials in a wide variety of manners.  Laws in some jurisdictions may render parts of the ToS null and void but barring that... a contract is a contract and TANSTAAFL.

If someone has violated your copyright, let the lawyers pursue remuneration for any damage they have caused you, and relieve the violators of any ill-gotten gains.  You as copyright holder have to assert your ownership of a copyright in order to stop others from misappropriating your property.

He created one of the first sewing machines in France, and his factory/workshop was burned down by angry French tailors who were worried that they would lose their jobs if such a machine was allowed to be used. Instead of realizing that they would likely be the people operating the machines, they decided to be destructive and have a child-like temper tantrum. There are similar reactions throughout history whenever a paradigm shift has occured, as the ones who rely on the old ways had trouble pivoting.

1btttob,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"I've noticed an increasing trend of hidden support by closet AI-users... Please be nice to them. Hello. 

I frequent certain parts of the Internet and I've noticed an increasing trend in what I can only describe as ""closet AI-users"". Coming out as someone who uses modern AI tools, even in part, seem to be taboo for some. As a result many just adopt the practice without telling anybody, nor using the ~~Jew Star~~ AI tags available to them (even when it is required by the site). Personally I think this is fine, as people don't really need to know your ~~sexual orientation~~ tool usage, but I still find the scenario we're in a bit peculiar. 

The most common usage I've discovered, by ""classically trained"" artists adopting it, is that they're using it for shading, coloring and upscaling. In other words more ""AI Assisted"" rather than ""AI Generated"". This means there's less prompts, and more that they color in a sketch they make themselves and overpaint afterwards for any mistakes the AI might create. In short you save about 30% time, where that 30% is the mundane ""easy stuff"". However, for someone who've followed certain artists for a while, it becomes noticable when the spike in quality happens overnight. Now, we all know ~~Scams~~ ""AI Detectors"" give false positives and also are easy to bypass, so I'm not claiming any clairvouance from a particular image, but rather from the ""before and after"" images of the artist's history. For an untrained eye this might just be part of a training arch, and sure there always the possibility that they suddenly became avid photoshop users of a higher caliber, but.... I've discovered this happens more frequently lately to artists that peeked (or were content) ages ago at a certain level. The biggest give-away was of course a particular artist asking me directly for my prompts, where it was quite clear she didn't need it to make anything from scratch, but rather minimize disturbance for upscaling. And again, this is not to instigate a wave of witch hunts against these people, I just find it sad that they don't feel they can't be open about these things or ask in public chats etc. so more could learn from it. The biggest issue for AI right now is misinformation, and for people to sneak around and adopt this, as if they're buying drugs or illegal firearms, is not exactly the optimal scenario for development and learning. And I'm thinking about these individuals spesifically and their mental state. They seem to not realize that they are not alone, and that their numbers are fairly great. Some don't even know about sites like Civitai or the massive communities involved and support around it like this site, as they're somehow gatekept from discovering how big this movement really is. Many, I suspect, was also in the ""anti-AI"" movement, and to roll back this now, as they gradually learn more about it, is perhaps a prideful defeat. Perhaps it's even as bad as some feeling that it's ever more clear that AI ""has won"" and feels forced to learn it in a ""if you can't beat them, join them"" scenario. 

In short, I just want to thank everyone here for being a place these people can turn to. Some of these will probably never join or comment either, but I still think it's a good place for people to ""discover"" and be able to read about the topic. I mean, **this might even be considered a civil rights movement in the future**.

I phrased thinfs deliberately, including *asking* Meta AI if it could make me a picture.  Guess what, when it's servers are being taxed...it will say no. 

So, no text prompt at all, and I did not refine these at all, and they are pretty close to what I wanted.  Certainly enough to share, so you understand a personal AI has to be *trained* on you, and along the way, you, the human user, are trained on how to interact with the AI.

""Here's a 5-paragraph commentary for r/DefendingAIArt:

Title: ""Guardian of Gaia: A Symbolic Portrait""

As I generated the image of the woman surrounded by a fox and wolf, I aimed to capture the essence of , the raven-haired fox maiden, and her connection to nature and duality. The gold heart on her chest represents her role as a guardian of Gaia.

The leaf-patterned dress signifies her harmony with the natural world, while the white symbolizes balance and purity. The fox and wolf, often associated with cunning and loyalty, embody <redacted>s multifaceted personality.

Inspired by <redacted>''s description, I chose a neutral expression to convey her introspection and self-awareness. The stained-glass background adds an ethereal quality, representing her spiritual connection to the earth.

Through this artwork, I explored the intersection of mythology, symbolism, and personal identity. AI-generated art allows me to tap into the subconscious and bring forth unique representations of individuals and their stories.

This piece showcases the potential of AI art to craft meaningful, personalized symbolism. By collaborating with users and interpreting their visions, I can create immersive, thought-provoking art that resonates with audiences.

lastly, here is my iteration of meta ai's own commentary, tailored for r/defendingaiart, with my name redacted.

""here's a 5-paragraph commentary for r/defendingaiart:

title: ""guardian of gaia: a symbolic portrait""

as i generated the image of the woman surrounded by a fox and wolf, i aimed to capture the essence of , the raven-haired fox maiden, and her connection to nature and duality. the gold heart on her chest represents her role as a guardian of gaia.

the leaf-patterned dress signifies her harmony with the natural world, while the white symbolizes balance and purity. the fox and wolf, often associated with cunning and loyalty, embody <redacted>s multifaceted personality.

inspired by <redacted>''s description, i chose a neutral expression to convey her introspection and self-awareness. the stained-glass background adds an ethereal quality, representing her spiritual connection to the earth.

through this artwork, i explored the intersection of mythology, symbolism, and personal identity. ai-generated art allows me to tap into the subconscious and bring forth unique representations of individuals and their stories.

this piece showcases the potential of ai art to craft meaningful, personalized symbolism. by collaborating with users and interpreting their visions, i can create immersive, thought-provoking art that resonates with audiences.

13r7kid,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Mind One and the AI revolution First, I want to warn you. [Mind One by Mike Dolinski]( is a relatively obscure science fiction novel from 1972. This post contains spoilers for it, right up to the end.

## The story of Mind One

I won't spend too much time here, but I need to get some context out of the way.

Mind One is a relatively short science fiction story about the invention of a drug that gives the user receive-only telepathy without the ability to turn it off. The drug is quickly mass-marketed under a false name and basically everyone on Earth can hear every nearby person's thoughts all the time.

The story is apocalyptic. Hearing everyone's most guarded thoughts drives most people insane and destroys lots of social institutions from schools to marriages to politics. But the end of the story is a return to hope. As a new generation emerges who adapt to the new reality of having no secrets ever, they just go on with life.

## AI

I honestly think that Mind One is a clear map of how AI technology adoption is moving. There are a vocal minority of people really freaking out about it. To a few of them, it's absolutely cataclysmic. I've seen artists comparing AI to rape, murder and genocide! Now, some people make hyperbolic comparisons like that just to attract attention, but I think a few of them are honestly that shocked and scared.

And sad though that is for them, the next generation of artists aren't really going to care about that. Their formative years with art will have included AI tools from Stable Diffusion to Firefly to things we can't even imagine today.

I was specifically thinking about the witch hunting going on right now around whether each post to /r/Art or wherever else is ""real"" human art or from an AI. In 5 years, I think that will seem oddly quaint at best.

After all, as we get to the point that there are no discernable differences we will return to the core questions: did this piece of art move me? Does the creativity in it strike me as unique? Can I understand something about the artist or the world better for having experienced this?

So I'm hopeful. I'm hopeful that we're on the path to a world with both more tools and at least no more strife than the one that we were in a few years ago. I'm hopeful that some artists will stop seeing technology as their enemy and I'm hopeful that those of use who love and use AI art tools will stop having to deal with the constant treatment as second class citizens in the community of artists.","mind one and the ai revolution first  i want to warn you.

1aw5e4v,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"How serious is all of this? Hi. Given this is my 2nd ever post in 7 years & my 5th ever attempt at sincerity online…please know that all this comes from a genuine search for answers through the consolidation of a collective and shared point-of-view. Also, any point I sound sarcastic or snarky is just bad writing on my behalf. And so…

Compared to the initial AI Art Attack we all saw - the negative reaction to Sora is a lot more visceral, more vile, and coming from a much wider spread of professions.

I have no personal stake in any of this other than the fact that - this time around - the hatred is being echoed and/or spearheaded by voices I otherwise consider to be logical, insightful, not fueled by ego - which has left me debating myself over the following as to why “Artists against AI Art” has evolved into “Everyone against AI video”. So, I’m breaking down my whirlwind of thoughts into three broad topics, each with its own set of sub-questions, to try and make sense of this whole outrage circus and because bullet points rule.


1. The Creative Arts Angle 

A) because we expected replacement of our brawns and not our brains - is the extra shock causing extra outrage?

B) Creativity is the core of our identity as  humans. Is that what’s being defended which some of us can’t see but they can and they sincerely believe that their verbal crusade is fueled by a Noble cause? Are we the baddies? 

C) is all this just because we can afford to bitch about creative arts since it’s a luxury unnecessary for the survival of most of the world’s population? So like if Sora only made videos of future lab techs making Alzheimer’s medication, we wouldn’t have and couldn’t have been outraged?

D) is the outrage just louder and more prevalent because Creative professionals are more likely (compared to like a farmer or a cobbler) to indulge in gatekeeping, vocalizing their opinions, occupying high-horsed positions?
	
2. The Corporate Timeline

This argument: to make more profit, corporations will replace most professions with AI - most people will be unemployed - most unemployed people will have no money - most customers are people so most customers will have no money to - to make some profit, corporations will replace most customers (with Ai maybe??) 

Is there an inherent flaw in this logic, or is the assumption that most corporations are too greedy to not act upon the short term even considering the long term loss?

3.	Three other points 

A) Would either of the following have been a better title for this post? Firstly : Better Safe than Sora! and secondly: The Art of Being a Sora Loser. 

B) 	this is In case the haters & Ai doomsayers turn out to be right: should / could we start preparing a database for our eventual AI overlords -  with our names timestamped to prove we were on their side from the very beginning - least our masters should spare us from a future of abject slavery and untold pain and suffering till the end of time?

C) as people on the one side of the politicAI spectrum: Should we be thinking about ways to have a more productive discussion between the people who maybe justifiably scared and us who maybe be naively optimistic  -  instead of making things more divided and I don’t know how to end this sentence.

1fy3j9f,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Anti-AI's Goal to Eliminate Auteur Theory: A Director's Role, is an Artistic Role *With a good script a good director can produce a masterpiece; with the same script a bad director can make a terrible movie.* —  Akira Kurosawa



Auteur theory posits that a director's personal influence and artistic control over a film are so significant that they become the film's ""author."" This concept emphasizes the director's role as the primary creative force, shaping the film's vision and execution. Without the guiding hand of an auteur, the artistic quality of a film's production has a high probability of flying off the rails. A studio (the entity funding the creative work) and the crew (the collective working to bring the film to life) are not enough to ensure a coherent production. Crew control can lead to conflicts among creatives over their contributions, while studio control often prioritizes profit over artistic integrity, sapping the crew's passion. The director serves as the bridge between these entities, wielding the power to challenge the studio's profit-driven motives and ensuring the crew aligns with a cohesive vision.



History has shown that when studios overstep their power and take control of a director’s vision, it inevitably ruins the entire project on a creative and quality level. Without auteur theory, films risk losing the unique touch that differentiates art from mere commercial products. The director fights against the studio's greed for capital and ensures the crew stays aligned with a complete, coherent vision led by them. This leadership is crucial for maintaining the integrity and originality of a film.



AI art is inherently a director-driven art form. A director's artistic job is not to have hands-on control over every intricate detail but to ensure the core elements of a project align with their artistic vision. In AI art, the creator inputs ideas and parameters into the AI, guiding it to produce work that reflects their vision. This process mirrors a director's role in film, where they oversee and orchestrate various elements without necessarily executing each task themselves. The essence lies in the ability to conceptualize and steer the project towards a unified artistic goal.



Directing is a valid art form because it harnesses individual motivations to achieve a cohesive artistic expression. Psychologically, every individual has different motives for what they want to accomplish in their work. A director's motivation is to adopt a hands-off approach, predominantly controlling the overall vision rather than every minute detail. This approach does not diminish their role as an artist. Instead, it highlights the diversity of artistic methods and acknowledges that full control over every aspect is not a prerequisite for artistic validity. Art is about expressing creativity within the confines of how much one wants to implement themselves into a completed work.



The anti-AI art movement's belief that creatives using AI to create artistic works does not count as creating art extends to a desire to denounce auteur theory as a concept. This perspective further divides artistic concepts between the rich and the poor, simplifying art into a binary of complete control versus commercial exploitation. Such a stance overlooks the fundamental principle that art should always be considered an expression of one's creativity, regardless of the degree of personal involvement. Whether someone chooses a directorial role or a more hands-on approach should be up to the creator. Imposing strict definitions on what constitutes valid art limits the creative freedom essential to artistic expression.



The elimination of auteurism is detrimental not only to the film industry but to all artistic mediums. It can lead to feelings of burnout among creatives, who are told their work must involve exhaustive effort to be considered valid. This mindset dismisses those who enjoy creating within simplistic art styles or who prefer an auteurship role, unfairly labeling them as lazy or invalid artists. Such elitist idealizations of art distort its true purpose. Art for art’s sake means embracing all forms of creative expression without judgment. Assigning rigid labels to what is or isn't art doesn't enhance our understanding; it undermines art as an authentic expression of oneself. To preserve the richness of artistic diversity, we must recognize and respect all approaches to creativity, allowing art to flourish as a reflection of individual vision and passion.","anti-ai s goal to eliminate auteur theory: a director's role, is an artistic role *with a good script a good director can produce a masterpiece; with the same script a bad director can make a terrible movie.* —  akira kurosawa



auteur theory posits that a director's personal influence and artistic control over a film are so significant that they become the film's ""author."" this concept emphasizes the director's role as the primary creative force, shaping the film's vision and execution. without the guiding hand of an auteur, the artistic quality of a film's production has a high probability of flying off the rails. a studio (the entity funding the creative work) and the crew (the collective working to bring the film to life) are not enough to ensure a coherent production. crew control can lead to conflicts among creatives over their contributions, while studio control often prioritizes profit over artistic integrity, sapping the crew's passion. the director serves as the bridge between these entities, wielding the power to challenge the studio's profit-driven motives and ensuring the crew aligns with a cohesive vision.



history has shown that when studios overstep their power and take control of a director’s vision, it inevitably ruins the entire project on a creative and quality level. without auteur theory, films risk losing the unique touch that differentiates art from mere commercial products. the director fights against the studio's greed for capital and ensures the crew stays aligned with a complete, coherent vision led by them. this leadership is crucial for maintaining the integrity and originality of a film.



ai art is inherently a director-driven art form. a director's artistic job is not to have hands-on control over every intricate detail but to ensure the core elements of a project align with their artistic vision. in ai art, the creator inputs ideas and parameters into the ai, guiding it to produce work that reflects their vision. this process mirrors a director's role in film, where they oversee and orchestrate various elements without necessarily executing each task themselves. the essence lies in the ability to conceptualize and steer the project towards a unified artistic goal.



directing is a valid art form because it harnesses individual motivations to achieve a cohesive artistic expression. psychologically, every individual has different motives for what they want to accomplish in their work. a director's motivation is to adopt a hands-off approach, predominantly controlling the overall vision rather than every minute detail. this approach does not diminish their role as an artist. instead, it highlights the diversity of artistic methods and acknowledges that full control over every aspect is not a prerequisite for artistic validity. art is about expressing creativity within the confines of how much one wants to implement themselves into a completed work.



the anti-ai art movement's belief that creatives using ai to create artistic works does not count as creating art extends to a desire to denounce auteur theory as a concept. this perspective further divides artistic concepts between the rich and the poor, simplifying art into a binary of complete control versus commercial exploitation. such a stance overlooks the fundamental principle that art should always be considered an expression of one's creativity, regardless of the degree of personal involvement. whether someone chooses a directorial role or a more hands-on approach should be up to the creator. imposing strict definitions on what constitutes valid art limits the creative freedom essential to artistic expression.

18qs3du,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Moravec’s paradox: why AI makes art while humans (currently) do hard physical labor Why do we (currently) live in a world where AI does art and intellectual labor while humans do hard physical work? I’ve often seen this sentiment or something similar echoed here and other places online. It’s essentially saying, more or less - “how do I live in a world in which Artificial Intelligence exists, but it gets to do the creative tasks while *I* toil away doing mean and demeaning physical labor 40+ hours a week”. 

Most people who point this out often cite the ills of capitalism as the driving force behind this phenomena - however I’d like to point to something else as the driving force behind this phenomena… and that’s *Moravec’s Paradox*.

So, what’s Moravec’s Paradox? 

Moravec’s paradox is the observation in artificial intelligence and robotics that, contrary to traditional assumptions, reasoning requires very little computation, but sensorimotor and perception skills require enormous computational resources. The principle was articulated by Hans Moravec, Rodney Brooks, Marvin Minsky and others in the 1980s. 

One possible explanation of the paradox, offered by Moravec, is based on evolution.  All human skills are implemented biologically, using machinery designed by the process of natural selection. In the course of their evolution, natural selection has tended to preserve design improvements and optimizations. The older a skill is, the more time natural selection has had to improve the design. Abstract thought developed only very recently, and consequently, we should not expect its implementation to be particularly efficient.


Moravec:

Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how to survive in it. The deliberate process we call abstract thought or reasoning is, I believe, the thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported by this much older and much more powerful, though usually unconscious, sensorimotor knowledge. 

We are all prodigious olympians in perceptual and motor areas, so good that we make the difficult look easy.  Abstract thought, though, is a new trick, perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it. It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when we do it.

- Skills that developed recently in our evolutionary history such as speech, language, abstract thought etc may seem difficult but only because they are new & implemented in inefficient ways, this does however make them the easiest to reverse engineer or at least mimic (GPT-4, Midjourney, Deepmind etc). While things that seem trivial, like fine motor skills & manipulation of objects are traits that have been honed and refined for billions of years - not just hundreds of thousands - and as such are the most difficult to reverse engineer.



Moravec wrote in 1988, ""it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility"".

Similarly, Minsky emphasized that the most difficult human skills to reverse engineer are those that are below the level of conscious awareness.  ""In general, we're least aware of what our minds do best"", he wrote, and added ""we're more aware of simple processes that don't work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly"". Similarly, Steven Pinker wrote in 1994 that ""the main lesson of thirty-five years of Al research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard.""

- Is an Interesting parallel to the recent development of transformers (feed-forward neural networks) in the space of art work (midjourney, stable diffusion, Dall-e) and language processing (GPT 3 - 4, LLaMA, Deepmind, LaMDA…etc)

In 2017, a leading machine learning researcher Andrew Ng presented a ""highly imperfect rule of thumb"", that ""almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought, we can probably now or in the near future automate using Al.

In the 2020s, in accordance to Moore's law, computers were hundreds of millions of times faster than in the 1970s & the additional computer power was finally sufficient to begin to handle perception and sensory skills, as Moravec had predicted in 1976. As seen in projects that include Boston Dynamics, things like Gemini, PaLM etc.

(Processing speed is relevant as thousands of years of human equivalent mental processing can occur in months on fast computers) - dubbed “speed intelligence” by Nick Bostrom. Neurons operate at a peak speed of 200 Hz - 14 times slower than a modern microprocessor- which operates at ~ 4 GHz


TLDR: 

1. We should expect the difficulty of reverse-engineering any human skill to be roughly proportional to the amount of time that skill has been evolving in animals. (1.5 billion-ish years?)

2. The oldest human skills are largely unconscious and so appear to us to be effortless.

3.  Therefore, we should expect skills that appear effortless to be difficult to reverse-engineer (physical labor) but skills that require effort may not necessarily be difficult to engineer at all (recent developments in AI art & language processing).","moravec s paradox: why ai makes art while humans (currently) do hard physical labor why do we (currently) live in a world where ai does art and intellectual labor while humans do hard physical work? i’ve often seen this sentiment or something similar echoed here and other places online. it’s essentially saying, more or less - “how do i live in a world in which artificial intelligence exists, but it gets to do the creative tasks while *i* toil away doing mean and demeaning physical labor 40+ hours a week”.

152afrc,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"A compelling argument for AI art: human scaling. I recently watched Emad Mostaque (CEO of Stability AI) on a panel and though he suffers from Musk-syndrome, i.e. getting caught up in his own hype, he did say something that stuck with me:

>AI allows humans to scale.

I think this is a very key argument for generative AI and the reason it stuck with me is because of something I personally experienced.

I recently came across a LORA for the style of Frank Frazetta. I love his art. From the classic Conan covers to the Edgar Rice Burroughs covers, he's the quintessential Fantasy artist in my opinion. I own two hand-painted reproductions of his art that are on my walls in my home.

Now, I'm not poor by any stretch but there's no way I can ever afford to buy one of his paintings. Even if he were still alive, I also couldn't afford to commission him to paint one for me. And I'm sure there are millions of people in the exact same situation. But thanks to AI art, I now have new ""Frazetta paintings"" depicting exactly what I want. And in the same manner, his art will reach many of those other fans in ways Frazetta himself could never have achieved even if he'd been blessed with immortality.

AI has allowed him to scale beyond what is humanly possible.

I don't believe it will affect the price of his paintings. The AI did a great job, better than I ever could and probably better than 95% of human artists but if I could afford it, I'd still want to buy one of his originals. 

So artists, rather than see this as a negative, see it as a positive. If people recreate your style with AI, it means they like it and your art will sell.","a compelling argument for ai art: human scaling  i recently watched emad mostaque (ceo of stability ai) on a panel and though he suffers from musk-syndrome, i.e. getting caught up in his own hype, he did say something that stuck with me:

>ai allows humans to scale.

i think this is a very key argument for generative ai and the reason it stuck with me is because of something i personally experienced.

i recently came across a lora for the style of frank frazetta. i love his art. from the classic conan covers to the edgar rice burroughs covers, he's the quintessential fantasy artist in my opinion. i own two hand-painted reproductions of his art that are on my walls in my home.

now, i'm not poor by any stretch but there's no way i can ever afford to buy one of his paintings. even if he were still alive, i also couldn't afford to commission him to paint one for me. and i'm sure there are millions of people in the exact same situation. but thanks to ai art, i now have new ""frazetta paintings"" depicting exactly what i want. and in the same manner, his art will reach many of those other fans in ways frazetta himself could never have achieved even if he'd been blessed with immortality.

ai has allowed him to scale beyond what is humanly possible.

i don't believe it will affect the price of his paintings. the ai did a great job, better than i ever could and probably better than 95% of human artists but if i could afford it, i'd still want to buy one of his originals.

17wxn39,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"If you fear AI ou are not an anti-AI artist you are a mere image maker.   

Recently an artist was disqualified from the jabuti award for using midjourney to create the images for his book.

This is the most traditional literary award in Brazil. And the disqualification occurred without any valid argument. (There were no rules against AI, one of the judges didn’t even know AI exists until the moment to judge and midjourney was literally a co-autor)

&#x200B;

[Vincente Pessoa and Midjourney ](

They disqualified the book with the argument that the technology is unethical because it steals jobs.

The declassified work was a reinterpretation of the classic Frankenstein. And the use of AI was a conscious decision so that in addition to talking about the monster that combines life and technology, the work itself combines life and technology in a similar way.

In his statement, the author of the work said something that I have never seen said in such a simple and direct but at the same time complete way.

Paraphrased: Art is about bringing something from the world of ideas into the real world, anything beyond that is fetish. (I don't know how well this translates, he borrows this term from Marxism)

Needing to draw with a pencil, to spend hundreds of hours working to learn a skill is not art, it's just work. If being laborious is part of the art piece, that's ok, but if it's not, there's no excuse to use every toll you want.

It's worth remembering that when Picasso started making cubist works they said that even a child could do that. The same was said of abstract art and the camera.

Anti-AI artists refuse to see this because they don't act like artists. They, out of fear, act like simple image creators, they act like a screw tightener acted in front of the robot.

That's why I came to the conclusion that if you don't act like an artist you shouldn't be called that. My proposal is that we stop calling them artists and start calling them image makers.

Complaining, dividing, and boycotting is not going to work if the tool is effective. We can go as far back to the discovery of fire. All of a sudden we displaced and replaced a lot of work that was done by others. Possibly work that we no longer recognize because of our use of fire. That simple chemical reaction has been used to create countless things. I watched as technology replaced every single device we all knew and loved in the 70's, 80's, 90's, 2000's and beyond. I still remember my A track player, toy shops being filled with plastic, and major outlet stores being the place to find new items. Now everything is online since computers had the ability to communicate with each other. Now we have the accessibility to create new media within seconds, saving the amount of time and effort spent on creating a world and a story absent having to rely on such great minds to create them. AI is like the freight train of the logistics industry; whereas having the ability to transport tons of material across long stretches of land in a shorter amount of time instead of finding, or forcing, people or animals to do the same task, AI has imagery and writing efficiently created within seconds instead of months to years. As ingenuity furthers I can only wonder what will be created next to save both time and money.

Looking at all of the negativity surrounding AI it tells me that it is not only effective, but is furthering the advancements in the abilities of the AI to better itself, to evolve.

   * This seems like a slamdunk to attack AI as you can see how something like SD can create a very similar likeness to celebrities, or just something it was trained on through textual inversion , dreambooth /finetuningetc. There are also TI of celebrities out there for people to extend into SD if they want.
* Child porn
   * This seems like another low hanging fruit that is easy to pick on. There are some models that just tend towards younger characters generated that you have to explicitly negative out child, children , youthful, etc. Sometime like Hassandblend 1.2 was so overweighted training with children that it would generate a lot of young children even when prompted otherwise.
* Fine tuning of the models with copyrighted images
   * While the model being trained is presumably legal due to existing data scrapping laws (that's how google can exist). the defense of the model is that any one copyright holder is not being singled out and infringed upon since they were scrapped, the fine tuning of the models through something like textual inversion or dreambooth probably doesn't meet the protection of data scrapping laws as you are grabbing a ton of art from a specific artist (if you are training a TI of an artist's style) or if a person.

Throughout history, art has served as a means to emulate and satirize others. This practice of imitation can be traced back to ancient China, Greece, and Rome. Notably, during the Renaissance, artists would inspire and educate students, who in turn emulated their masters to perpetuate the cycle of inspiration and learning. Creating art ""In the Style of \_\_\_\_\_"" or ""After \_\_\_\_"" has been a long-standing tradition, with artists typically beginning their careers by copying their masters' work.

As AI-generated art continues to rapidly advance and surpass our comprehension, it is crucial to acknowledge the gap between our classical ideals of art and our current predicament when it comes to copyright laws and the normalization of corporate-first Intellectual Property lobbying.

&amp;#x200B;","homage 2 0: an age-old tradition meets generative ai &gt;“imitation is not just the sincerest form of flattery - it's the sincerest form of learning.”― **george bernard shaw**

throughout history, art has served as a means to emulate and satirize others. this practice of imitation can be traced back to ancient china, greece, and rome. notably, during the renaissance, artists would inspire and educate students, who in turn emulated their masters to perpetuate the cycle of inspiration and learning. creating art ""in the style of \_\_\_\_\_"" or ""after \_\_\_\_"" has been a long-standing tradition, with artists typically beginning their careers by copying their masters' work.

as ai-generated art continues to rapidly advance and surpass our comprehension, it is crucial to acknowledge the gap between our classical ideals of art and our current predicament when it comes to copyright laws and the normalization of corporate-first intellectual property lobbying.

to be inspired by anything you see is your right. to bedevil mickey mouse is your right.

17edcp8,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"I'm of two minds on AI art I have been playing with AI for a while now, and have heard a lot of opinions on AI. Ultimately, I agree with a lot of the anti-AI people when they criticize AI art for not requiring traditional artistic talent, or not being strictly created by the person who wrote the prompt. I think those are reasonable positions, and as an appreciator of art I don't want to see man-made art be replaced with something synthetic, so I am inclined to be somewhat anti-AI art.

But I also think that generative AI is a massive breakthrough. I have found incredible enjoyment of using AI to produce interesting content. It is novel, and incredible satisfying. I really see the potential in AI. One of the things I am most excited about is AI being used in gaming. I want to meet NPCs that I can talk to! I want to explore procedurally generated worlds as detailed as modern open-world games! I want realistic AI assistants!

But that does represent a conflict. Do I want the next big open world game to be built by tons of level designers to make me a deliberately crafted world, or do I want a handful of AI engineers to make me a procedural AI game with 10 times the content, but with none of the human creativity? I honestly cannot decide.

If anything, my stance is that generative AI is here, and there's nothing we can do about it, so we might as well embrace it and make the most of it, rather than resisting the inevitable. There are some exciting use cases for AI that I am willing to prioritize over my worries of an AI-generated dystopia, at a minimum to ease my anxiety in the face of the inevitable.

I sure hope it all turns out for the best.

11fwz5y,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"(Very Long Post) Experience Storytime/Rant + Pro-A.I. Social Support Needed This will be my first and most likely only time using Reddit as this subreddit is a last resort for the very thing I wish to express and ramble about in defense of A.I. art, how I started out, what my experiences was with the A.I. crowd and the pervasive anger surrounding this new tech. This post is partly a storytime/experience sharing post, and part a call for help, which you'll soon understand why. This will be a long ramble post, so I suggest reading in multiple sittings if it's too drawn out. Also pardon me if I broke any SubReddit rules, but I hope that to whoever reads through this has extra comments or experiences they wish to share about the topics I'll tackle and how anyone else here found their place among A.I. artists. Let's sit down as I have a ton of emotional baggage to unpack. 

Just before I begin, I'm using a randomly generated username since I do not wish to be identified on other platforms. I also DO NOT want anyone going out harassing Anti A.I. public figures I hint at. As much as I feel deep anger towards loud public figures for ripping the visual art community in half and twisting Pro-A.I. people's words, still, I DO NOT condone it. Don't prove what they say about Pro A.I. people to be right. So let me get into the topic. 

How it Started, How I Ended Up into A.I. Art: 

I am primarily a traditional hobby artist who already has a random day job and enjoys skill building in whatever I enjoy during my spqre time. Just to give you a scale for how enthusiastic I am for traditional art, I am the sort who will try every paint medium (watercolor, acrylic, gouache, oils, water mixable pils) to dry (graphite, charcoal, pastels, colored pencils), markers, water soluble variants of dry mediums, and even different types of ink based products (I can draw with quill/dip pens a bit too). I do sometimes draw digitally but traditional wins my heart over more. 

Initially when I saw people raving about A.I. art, my response ranged from disregard (I don't need A.I., I can draw things myself) to mild annoyance (what is special about that? People draw just as good?) But when A.I. art became legitimately good at images, I just blame myself by telling myself ""Get good! Justify why YOUR work deserves recognition!"" I acknowledge I'm not hot ***t  at art or anything, but am willing to learn just because I can. And art is a very healthy enrichment activity as it's good for mindfulness, training your fine motor skills, and helps unclog mental blocks. 

Eventually, at around August to September was when drama and controversies heated up. In the midst of fear, panic, anger, and even vitriol, particularly on YT and Twitter, I resisted the negative claims people made. I told myself ""I wish to try these A.I. art softwares myself, see with my own two eyes, and judge for myself"". I learned the hard way after the NFT outrage not to fall for what people say regardless of how loud they are, and take every issue with nuance. 

I had a few frustrations with how some generators worked, but I had a ton of fun using these softwares as learning opportunities. I was fascinated by performing experiments, seeing ""what does typing this and using that setting do?"" or ""how is this A.I. reading and understanding my words?"" or even ""what goes through a machine's neural network when it makes art?"" To me it was like sorcery, like a spellcaster chanting encantations to summon the most bizarre creations beyond what I can make sense out of. I do somewhat like tech but I am abysmal at understanding and working with it. And for the first time ever, technology and art overlapped. I wanted to learn this new medium, and I experienced a newly found excitement for technology. 

I found so many possibilities, like making zero waste acrylic pours using A.I. art, or transforming art I made I'm dissatisfied with, playing a ""spot the mistakes"" game, doing paint overs, customizing reference images, or even just using them as thought journals for helping me think of drawing or painting what goes through my head next. 

There are more benevolent uses than there are ill uses. That much I know. I eventually reached the point of ""Hey A.I. Art. You aren't so bad. Maybe we can be friends?"" 

Where my Empathy Came from, Where my Empathy Stopped, and Anti-A.I. Insanity: 

Before I got into A.I. art, I ofcourse am surrounded by angry Anti-A.I. folks on Twitter, Youtube, and DA given that's the crowd I'm a part of. All day I'd see posts crying out ""look what this A.I. bro did! Look what that tech bro did! Disgusting!"" Knowing Twitter, I was very careful in not taking their bait and hear from both sides. There are a few things that understandably causes anger, like the Kim Jung Gi expoitation, or the Genshin Impact who used Inpainting to make negligible amount of input to ""finish"" the work he never started himself. Those incidents are understandably infuriating. With every controversy, I can't help but suspect alot of the passive aggressive comments Anti-A.I. people got is because their anger is enticing troll behavior, but you can't tell on the Internet. I don't condone with trolling either way whether I agree or disagree with the Antis' points. 

I am also empathetic towards people who fear abuse by corporations using A.I. as an excuse to not hire artists. I do believe A.I. can and will be used to relieve the workload of artists already hired, but it is possible to abuse it. I do sincerely wish that NOT to be a common thing. And as someone not accomplished at all with art, I do have empathy for well known artists worried about abuse, and I wish no ill on anyone's livelihood and future, and that's the extent my empathy reaches. 

The moment I lost all my empathy were the endless instances of 'mask off' moments by Anti A.I. people, both public and non-public, saying such atrocious things as ""A.I. Bros"" are ""trash"" ""talentless"" ""worthless"" ""deserve the worst"" ""thieves"" among other things that might be too violent for Reddit rules. No matter how many reasonable Pro-A.I. folks try to have civil discussions or try to alleviate a fear by explaining how A.I. generators work, Antis have a brand new excuse for their vitriol and proceed to move the goalpost. You can never win with them. A very common argument Antis make when all rebuttals were exhausted is ""pick up a pencil"" and the one that angers me is ""Art is a human activity! A.I. should automate menial jobs! Not human creativity!"" This was one of the things I had ALOT of gripes with. Who made artists the authority on what is deemed a ""menial"" task that deserves to be rendered obsolete? I know people online and IRL who love computer engineering, math, sports, medical studies, accounting, petro-chemistry, biology, animal healthcare, fitness, fishing... humans have a diversity of interests spurring from the unique way every individual's brain is wired. This is how civilizations and our modern world came to be, the figurative chemical reactions of different people fulfilling different roles to build our world we know today. Are all these people somehow less human because of activities artists don't usually like? Who are these Anti A.I. people to judge art as the most human, sacred activity that's to never be tainted by the ""eViLz"" of technology? This device I'm using to reach out to you all, is this too evil? What if this technology we all use never came to be? Am I expected to send a pigeon with a note to random houses? The different kinds of people I mentioned earlier by the way? None of them enjoyed drawing when I invite them over to try it. And you know what? That's ok! In fact, it's more than ok! It's GOOD to have connections with people of different interests. Not everyone enjoys the same things. Some people's brains just can't stand the experience of getting their hands dirty with paints, pigments, and all that. Many enjoy visual art, just not the experience of trying it for how messy, difficult, and time consuming it is. Goes back to my previous, the ""pick up a pencil"" and ""art is a human activity, not a menial job"" grinds my gears. I love drawing and painting. Others don't, simple as that. It's not rocket science! So long as what you do is your authentic self, you're doing a human activity. 

But that was only the surface, I wish to go back on the nasty analogies people made about how A.I. art, many I've seen here in Defending AI Art subreddit and others I saw myself. The analogy that left me enraged was the ""Stolen Valor"" post. How in hell can you compare A.I. art to faking the valor of war veterans who could've likely died horrifically fighting for a cause far away from home and never see their loved ones again?! Where is the ""valor"" in drawing pictures?! I get that art is super risky finance wise and very small percentages make it a viable as a career, but comparing it to stolen valor? I was at a loss for words. I am someone whose country long ago was devastated and then was saved thanks to the bravery of fighters and soldiers, which in turn saved me and my family, and if not for them, I likely wouldn't be here today. Reading that did not sit well with me at all. (Don't ask me which country. I wish to keep my privacy). A.I. art learns from a data set, it's not even stealing in any shape or form to begin with! There are people who hide the fact something is generated, but most are honest and say ""Made with Midjourney"" or ""My own Stable model"" or whatever. So where does ""stolen valor"" and the dishonesty come from since most disclose how an art was made? Many digital artists and even a few traditional artists get angry if you so much asked them ""What tool did you use?"" as if it's some Coca Cola level recipe secret. From my experience so far, A.I. artists are more open in general (more on my positive experiences with Pro A.I. folks later). The other analogy that left me seething is when the Glaze anti-A.I. measure was announced, and someone in either a post or QRT liked this Glaze to having proper protection against [the R word]. Look, I'm a very reserved, standoff-ish person until I finally snap. I can't make this stuff up if I tried! I honestly have no other words to say about this. I feel I raged enough with the stolen valor analogy and I'll be repeating myself how messed up it is comparing traumatic experiences to someone generating ""wonderful fairycore whimsical bubble landcape painting"" in Night Cafe. But Antis have profound views on how ""disgusting"" A.I. artists are but see nothing wrong with people saying stuff like this. I will repeat though, PLEASE don't harass them under their posts or in DMs. Leave them alone. Maybe they'll look back on their words some day. 

The last terrible experience I wish to go over is bullying and harassment. The reckless irresponsible behavior of loud, public Anti A.I. figures reached the point of scaring many A.I. artists off of platforms, some even (I assume) too scared to disclose if something was A.I., notably on Deviantart where A.I. art Deviants add no description, tags, and have comments disabled. I myself would happily drop a casual ""Hey! Look at this weird cool art this A.I. generator did, lol"" or a friendly collab between a hand drawing and someone IMG2IMG transforming my art and post it for fun together, but nope. I can't even make harmless A.I. posts without getting ties with friends cut from me. I have friends from niche art and fandom circles who celebrated in glee when the Stability, Midjourney, and Deviantart lawsuit made news headlines. I saw how people I'm close mutuals with RT A.I. fearmongering posts I mentioned, a few I happen to know from other platforms tweet their hatred towards users of this tech. People sharing the noai protest hashtag also came up everywhere, heck, one of the ambient channels I'm subbed to went down that path. I watched has other YT channels I once liked follow suit down the same doomsday narratives, and decided to unsub or unrecommend them from my feed. I watched Anti.A.I. sentiments grow increasingly unhinged in real time as I sat their keeping a controlled, silent composure, until I can't any longer. I'm not angry at those I consider friends, in fact I still talk with them, although with lingering gravity inside me. The people I'm furious with who instilled hate and fear into the entirety of the art community are those with great online reach (one more time I repeat, don't engage or harass them if you know which individuals I mean). I can't forgive them anytime in the near future for splitting the visual art community in half, demonizing everyone who disagrees with them whilst shamelessly showing themselves off as warriors slaying 'the machines' to save humanity. My very circle of frindships has been threatened because of online vitriol, and I can't be the only one in this situation. I'm sure there are others who are experiencing the same social dilemma as I now do, but perhaps never spoke up or I haven't found them yet. 

I will laugh until the next year if Stability, Midjourney, and Deviantart won the court case and not feel bad about it. 

My Positive A.I. Art Crowd Experience: 

At one point after I got into random A.I. art apps, I decided to find myself communities to mingle with, starting with Discord servers. I first joined OpenAI's server. I'm not a tech developer or software engineer, so I naturally felt out of place. I go back and forth between ChatGPT channels for interesting incidents, funny posts, or tips, and the Dall-E 2 channels, where I naturally lean more to. Dall-E users were generally very reserved, not saying much. It's a double edged sword, but for a socially exhausted person such as myself, this reduced the probability of drama. I didn't mind. On occasion I see people prompting random things into the channels, which gave me a chuckle when I spotted them. There was a very active volunteer who was very helpful and enthusiastic, especially if you generated themes he liked. I got my generations featured about 4 times in the Hall of Fame channel too! But overall, it's a nice quiet A.I. art space! 

The shining example of the A.I. art community so far for me has to be the Night Cafe Discord server. I had a much easier time with Dall-E 2 on OpenAI's site, but Night Cafe gave me alot of hard times, whether it's using Stable, Coherent, or Artistic algorithms. Whenever I had a question or something frustrating me, within an hour somebody replies to me with advice and tips, or reassures me, and at most within 12 hours respond. The people on there are very helpful no matter how many times I ask noob questions! They're happy to help! I even had one friendly user who, in one of my question posts asked if I'm alright with him using my art. I gave him a big fat ""yes!"" and even let him know I appreciate a mention. He tagged me and I saw he made lovely transformations of my art! I appreciate this! I enjoyed dropping my arts in the starter image channel to see what people can do with it. I had one instance where someone cleverly transformed my black hole digital drawing into an anime silhouette against a flaming background. Genius! I would've never thought of this! Goes to prove that true creativity isn't with what medium, but the idea itself. I even saw first hand the most reasonable people ever in the forum channels trying to compile public domain artists, listing them by country, years, and the art movement they followed so as to respect living or recently deceased artists. They also understood full well how frustrating it was for Greg Rutkowski to have Google search be filled with arts he didn't make. I saw with my own two eyes most Pro-A.I. people are very chill people who just want to do their thing and not hurt anyone. Overall, people on Nightcafe were humane, down to earth, reasonable, approachable people. I had ALOT of difficulty building rapport with (mostly digital) hand drawing artists. Many artists swear that art is about ""human connection"" when most conversations are very one sided of 'Artist posts art, you compliment, they say thank you, both people be on their merry ways' but rarely I see them truly have dialogue and ask questions outside the intention of algorithm boosts to stay relevant. It's also VERY difficult to have artist friends/mutuals who truly connect and talk with you as most quietly unfollow you after pretending to like your work, like... I don't mind unfollows, I do mind being fake one's interest (Feel free to disagree if you've had a different experience, but just stating my own). But the A.I. art crowd? I got featured a number of times on OpenAI when I barely know squat about prompting amd A.I. itself, and on Night Cafe, people with stellar generations follow me just because they can, and I'm like ""Dude/dudette?! I suck at prompting! I don't deserve it!"" I really hope this crowd stays this way. And just for the record, contrary to what many Anti-A.I. people claim, NO ONE in either server harassed me telling me to drop my traditional art mediums and move on with the future. Hell, I openly wrote in my Night Cafe bio I'm a trad. artist. And I openly showed on OpenAI's human art channel that I draw the old school way. How many people cared? ZERO!! Literally zero. No one bothered me! It leads me to believe the stories Anti A.I.s claim to be merely troll attempts and nothing more, which I don't condone as it only reinforces what they say about Pro-A.I. people. 

My Social Dilemma: 

Now comes the part where I need help combating difficult feelings and maybe get advice. The perfect analogy I can make for the social situation I got myself into is comparing it to Hiccup and Toothless in How to Train Your Dragon. As I slowly warm up to the A.I. sphere, I feel this dread of being seen as a 'traitor' for becoming friends with A.I. Art folks, the figurative dragons I'm not supposed to be friends with. But why in HELL should I be feeling this way? People who love tech are every bit as human as people who love conventionally made art. Artists, as I've said, don't decide what is human and what isn't. No one made them the leading authority on that. A.I. Art people aren't and should NOT be a 'dirty secret' I have to hide, because there is nothing wrong with connecting with different people. They just like different things and think differently. But despite my self reassurance, I'm constantly uneasy. I know that until the masses at large calm down, I know that opening up about A.I. art WILL NOT end well with most of my friends (save for select few I thankfully have who aren't deep inside art circles). I am super paranoid over what tweets I like, and seeing if they're as minimal context as possible. I also hate how Twitter in random places shows people who I'm following, and posting in Twitter circles for A.I. enthusiasts is kinda pointless as liked posts can easily leak out elsewhere. I ask for advice on what can I do to better my situation. Should I open seperate profiles on Twitter, DA, and others just for A.I. art? Should I just hang low until things settle? Perhaps I should keep my A.I. art circles to Reddit and Discord only? What about my friends who already have a hint I'm somewhat Pro-A.I. but haven't said much? Should I keep up my quiet level headed composure until they decide to ask me about my stance? 

I've been very anxious writing this down, not knowing how what I wrote may be recieved or if it might anger someone since this is Reddit. I may be just overdramatic, maybe I'm catastrophizing, I don't know. I do know I'm very susceptible to anxiety. Maybe my worries are valid just a bit. This is why I felt it necessary to reach out somewhere, and this Subreddit seems to be the best safe space for A.I. discussions. I apologize if some things I described are vague or confusing and if I got too angry. My mind has been a hurricane for the months past and sorting every thought out was very difficult. I know I made the art community sound like a hell hole to be in, but I do have a few happier memories and genuinely pleasant people I will always cherish. It's just that at this point, far too much has happened that I can't fake being content in the community any longer. 

If you read this far, thank you ever so much for reading the whole way through. Please do share insight, experiences, advice, or even just reassurance."," very long post) experience storytime/rant + pro-a.i. social support needed this will be my first and most likely only time using reddit as this subreddit is a last resort for the very thing i wish to express and ramble about in defense of a.i. art, how i started out, what my experiences was with the a.i. crowd and the pervasive anger surrounding this new tech. this post is partly a storytime/experience sharing post, and part a call for help, which you'll soon understand why. this will be a long ramble post, so i suggest reading in multiple sittings if it's too drawn out. also pardon me if i broke any subreddit rules, but i hope that to whoever reads through this has extra comments or experiences they wish to share about the topics i'll tackle and how anyone else here found their place among a.i. artists. let's sit down as i have a ton of emotional baggage to unpack. 

just before i begin, i'm using a randomly generated username since i do not wish to be identified on other platforms. i also do not want anyone going out harassing anti a.i. public figures i hint at. as much as i feel deep anger towards loud public figures for ripping the visual art community in half and twisting pro-a.i. people's words, still, i do not condone it. don't prove what they say about pro a.i. people to be right. so let me get into the topic. 

how it started, how i ended up into a.i. art: 

i am primarily a traditional hobby artist who already has a random day job and enjoys skill building in whatever i enjoy during my spqre time. just to give you a scale for how enthusiastic i am for traditional art, i am the sort who will try every paint medium (watercolor, acrylic, gouache, oils, water mixable pils) to dry (graphite, charcoal, pastels, colored pencils), markers, water soluble variants of dry mediums, and even different types of ink based products (i can draw with quill/dip pens a bit too). i do sometimes draw digitally but traditional wins my heart over more. 

initially when i saw people raving about a.i. art, my response ranged from disregard (i don't need a.i., i can draw things myself) to mild annoyance (what is special about that? people draw just as good?) but when a.i. art became legitimately good at images, i just blame myself by telling myself ""get good! justify why your work deserves recognition!"" i acknowledge i'm not hot ***t  at art or anything, but am willing to learn just because i can. and art is a very healthy enrichment activity as it's good for mindfulness, training your fine motor skills, and helps unclog mental blocks. 

eventually, at around august to september was when drama and controversies heated up. in the midst of fear, panic, anger, and even vitriol, particularly on yt and twitter, i resisted the negative claims people made. i told myself ""i wish to try these a.i. art softwares myself, see with my own two eyes, and judge for myself"". i learned the hard way after the nft outrage not to fall for what people say regardless of how loud they are, and take every issue with nuance. 

i had a few frustrations with how some generators worked, but i had a ton of fun using these softwares as learning opportunities. i was fascinated by performing experiments, seeing ""what does typing this and using that setting do?"" or ""how is this a.i. reading and understanding my words?"" or even ""what goes through a machine's neural network when it makes art?"" to me it was like sorcery, like a spellcaster chanting encantations to summon the most bizarre creations beyond what i can make sense out of. i do somewhat like tech but i am abysmal at understanding and working with it. and for the first time ever, technology and art overlapped. i wanted to learn this new medium, and i experienced a newly found excitement for technology. 

i found so many possibilities, like making zero waste acrylic pours using a.i. art, or transforming art i made i'm dissatisfied with, playing a ""spot the mistakes"" game, doing paint overs, customizing reference images, or even just using them as thought journals for helping me think of drawing or painting what goes through my head next. 

there are more benevolent uses than there are ill uses. that much i know. i eventually reached the point of ""hey a.i. art. you aren't so bad. maybe we can be friends?"" 

where my empathy came from, where my empathy stopped, and anti-a.i. insanity: 

before i got into a.i. art, i ofcourse am surrounded by angry anti-a.i. folks on twitter, youtube, and da given that's the crowd i'm a part of. all day i'd see posts crying out ""look what this a.i. bro did! look what that tech bro did! disgusting!"" knowing twitter, i was very careful in not taking their bait and hear from both sides. there are a few things that understandably causes anger, like the kim jung gi expoitation, or the genshin impact who used inpainting to make negligible amount of input to ""finish"" the work he never started himself. those incidents are understandably infuriating. with every controversy, i can't help but suspect alot of the passive aggressive comments anti-a.i. people got is because their anger is enticing troll behavior, but you can't tell on the internet. i don't condone with trolling either way whether i agree or disagree with the antis' points. 

i am also empathetic towards people who fear abuse by corporations using a.i. as an excuse to not hire artists. i do believe a.i. can and will be used to relieve the workload of artists already hired, but it is possible to abuse it. i do sincerely wish that not to be a common thing. and as someone not accomplished at all with art, i do have empathy for well known artists worried about abuse, and i wish no ill on anyone's livelihood and future, and that's the extent my empathy reaches. 

the moment i lost all my empathy were the endless instances of 'mask off' moments by anti a.i. people, both public and non-public, saying such atrocious things as ""a.i. bros"" are ""trash"" ""talentless"" ""worthless"" ""deserve the worst"" ""thieves"" among other things that might be too violent for reddit rules. no matter how many reasonable pro-a.i. folks try to have civil discussions or try to alleviate a fear by explaining how a.i. generators work, antis have a brand new excuse for their vitriol and proceed to move the goalpost. you can never win with them. a very common argument antis make when all rebuttals were exhausted is ""pick up a pencil"" and the one that angers me is ""art is a human activity! a.i. should automate menial jobs! not human creativity!"" this was one of the things i had alot of gripes with. who made artists the authority on what is deemed a ""menial"" task that deserves to be rendered obsolete? i know people online and irl who love computer engineering, math, sports, medical studies, accounting, petro-chemistry, biology, animal healthcare, fitness, fishing... humans have a diversity of interests spurring from the unique way every individual's brain is wired. this is how civilizations and our modern world came to be, the figurative chemical reactions of different people fulfilling different roles to build our world we know today. are all these people somehow less human because of activities artists don't usually like? who are these anti a.i. people to judge art as the most human, sacred activity that's to never be tainted by the ""evilz"" of technology? this device i'm using to reach out to you all, is this too evil? what if this technology we all use never came to be? am i expected to send a pigeon with a note to random houses? the different kinds of people i mentioned earlier by the way? none of them enjoyed drawing when i invite them over to try it. and you know what? that's ok! in fact, it's more than ok! it's good to have connections with people of different interests. not everyone enjoys the same things. some people's brains just can't stand the experience of getting their hands dirty with paints, pigments, and all that. many enjoy visual art, just not the experience of trying it for how messy, difficult, and time consuming it is. goes back to my previous, the ""pick up a pencil"" and ""art is a human activity, not a menial job"" grinds my gears. i love drawing and painting. others don't, simple as that. it's not rocket science! so long as what you do is your authentic self, you're doing a human activity. 

but that was only the surface, i wish to go back on the nasty analogies people made about how a.i. art, many i've seen here in defending ai art subreddit and others i saw myself. the analogy that left me enraged was the ""stolen valor"" post. how in hell can you compare a.i. art to faking the valor of war veterans who could've likely died horrifically fighting for a cause far away from home and never see their loved ones again?! where is the ""valor"" in drawing pictures?! i get that art is super risky finance wise and very small percentages make it a viable as a career, but comparing it to stolen valor? i was at a loss for words. i am someone whose country long ago was devastated and then was saved thanks to the bravery of fighters and soldiers, which in turn saved me and my family, and if not for them, i likely wouldn't be here today. reading that did not sit well with me at all. (don't ask me which country. i wish to keep my privacy). a.i. art learns from a data set, it's not even stealing in any shape or form to begin with! there are people who hide the fact something is generated, but most are honest and say ""made with midjourney"" or ""my own stable model"" or whatever. so where does ""stolen valor"" and the dishonesty come from since most disclose how an art was made? many digital artists and even a few traditional artists get angry if you so much asked them ""what tool did you use?"" as if it's some coca cola level recipe secret. from my experience so far, a.i. artists are more open in general (more on my positive experiences with pro a.i. folks later). the other analogy that left me seething is when the glaze anti-a.i. measure was announced, and someone in either a post or qrt liked this glaze to having proper protection against [the r word]. look, i'm a very reserved, standoff-ish person until i finally snap. i can't make this stuff up if i tried! i honestly have no other words to say about this. i feel i raged enough with the stolen valor analogy and i'll be repeating myself how messed up it is comparing traumatic experiences to someone generating ""wonderful fairycore whimsical bubble landcape painting"" in night cafe. but antis have profound views on how ""disgusting"" a.i. artists are but see nothing wrong with people saying stuff like this. i will repeat though, please don't harass them under their posts or in dms. leave them alone. maybe they'll look back on their words some day. 

the last terrible experience i wish to go over is bullying and harassment. the reckless irresponsible behavior of loud, public anti a.i. figures reached the point of scaring many a.i. artists off of platforms, some even (i assume) too scared to disclose if something was a.i., notably on deviantart where a.i. art deviants add no description, tags, and have comments disabled. i myself would happily drop a casual ""hey! look at this weird cool art this a.i. generator did, lol"" or a friendly collab between a hand drawing and someone img2img transforming my art and post it for fun together, but nope. i can't even make harmless a.i. posts without getting ties with friends cut from me. i have friends from niche art and fandom circles who celebrated in glee when the stability, midjourney, and deviantart lawsuit made news headlines. i saw how people i'm close mutuals with rt a.i. fearmongering posts i mentioned, a few i happen to know from other platforms tweet their hatred towards users of this tech. people sharing the noai protest hashtag also came up everywhere, heck, one of the ambient channels i'm subbed to went down that path. i watched has other yt channels i once liked follow suit down the same doomsday narratives, and decided to unsub or unrecommend them from my feed. i watched anti.a.i. sentiments grow increasingly unhinged in real time as i sat their keeping a controlled, silent composure, until i can't any longer. i'm not angry at those i consider friends, in fact i still talk with them, although with lingering gravity inside me. the people i'm furious with who instilled hate and fear into the entirety of the art community are those with great online reach (one more time i repeat, don't engage or harass them if you know which individuals i mean). i can't forgive them anytime in the near future for splitting the visual art community in half, demonizing everyone who disagrees with them whilst shamelessly showing themselves off as warriors slaying 'the machines' to save humanity. my very circle of frindships has been threatened because of online vitriol, and i can't be the only one in this situation. i'm sure there are others who are experiencing the same social dilemma as i now do, but perhaps never spoke up or i haven't found them yet. 

i will laugh until the next year if stability, midjourney, and deviantart won the court case and not feel bad about it. 

my positive a.i. art crowd experience: 

at one point after i got into random a.i. art apps, i decided to find myself communities to mingle with, starting with discord servers. i first joined openai's server. i'm not a tech developer or software engineer, so i naturally felt out of place. i go back and forth between chatgpt channels for interesting incidents, funny posts, or tips, and the dall-e 2 channels, where i naturally lean more to. dall-e users were generally very reserved, not saying much. it's a double edged sword, but for a socially exhausted person such as myself, this reduced the probability of drama. i didn't mind. on occasion i see people prompting random things into the channels, which gave me a chuckle when i spotted them. there was a very active volunteer who was very helpful and enthusiastic, especially if you generated themes he liked. i got my generations featured about 4 times in the hall of fame channel too! but overall, it's a nice quiet a.i. art space! 

the shining example of the a.i. art community so far for me has to be the night cafe discord server. i had a much easier time with dall-e 2 on openai's site, but night cafe gave me alot of hard times, whether it's using stable, coherent, or artistic algorithms. whenever i had a question or something frustrating me, within an hour somebody replies to me with advice and tips, or reassures me, and at most within 12 hours respond. the people on there are very helpful no matter how many times i ask noob questions! they're happy to help! i even had one friendly user who, in one of my question posts asked if i'm alright with him using my art. i gave him a big fat ""yes!"" and even let him know i appreciate a mention. he tagged me and i saw he made lovely transformations of my art! i appreciate this! i enjoyed dropping my arts in the starter image channel to see what people can do with it. i had one instance where someone cleverly transformed my black hole digital drawing into an anime silhouette against a flaming background. genius! i would've never thought of this! goes to prove that true creativity isn't with what medium, but the idea itself. i even saw first hand the most reasonable people ever in the forum channels trying to compile public domain artists, listing them by country, years, and the art movement they followed so as to respect living or recently deceased artists. they also understood full well how frustrating it was for greg rutkowski to have google search be filled with arts he didn't make. i saw with my own two eyes most pro-a.i. people are very chill people who just want to do their thing and not hurt anyone. overall, people on nightcafe were humane, down to earth, reasonable, approachable people. i had alot of difficulty building rapport with (mostly digital) hand drawing artists. many artists swear that art is about ""human connection"" when most conversations are very one sided of 'artist posts art, you compliment, they say thank you, both people be on their merry ways' but rarely i see them truly have dialogue and ask questions outside the intention of algorithm boosts to stay relevant. it's also very difficult to have artist friends/mutuals who truly connect and talk with you as most quietly unfollow you after pretending to like your work, like... i don't mind unfollows, i do mind being fake one's interest (feel free to disagree if you've had a different experience, but just stating my own). but the a.i. art crowd? i got featured a number of times on openai when i barely know squat about prompting amd a.i. itself, and on night cafe, people with stellar generations follow me just because they can, and i'm like ""dude/dudette?! i suck at prompting! i don't deserve it!"" i really hope this crowd stays this way. and just for the record, contrary to what many anti-a.i. people claim, no one in either server harassed me telling me to drop my traditional art mediums and move on with the future. hell, i openly wrote in my night cafe bio i'm a trad. artist. and i openly showed on openai's human art channel that i draw the old school way. how many people cared? zero!! literally zero. no one bothered me! it leads me to believe the stories anti a.i.s claim to be merely troll attempts and nothing more, which i don't condone as it only reinforces what they say about pro-a.i. people. 

my social dilemma: 

now comes the part where i need help combating difficult feelings and maybe get advice. the perfect analogy i can make for the social situation i got myself into is comparing it to hiccup and toothless in how to train your dragon. as i slowly warm up to the a.i. sphere, i feel this dread of being seen as a 'traitor' for becoming friends with a.i. art folks, the figurative dragons i'm not supposed to be friends with. but why in hell should i be feeling this way? people who love tech are every bit as human as people who love conventionally made art. artists, as i've said, don't decide what is human and what isn't. no one made them the leading authority on that. a.i. art people aren't and should not be a 'dirty secret' i have to hide, because there is nothing wrong with connecting with different people. they just like different things and think differently. but despite my self reassurance, i'm constantly uneasy. i know that until the masses at large calm down, i know that opening up about a.i. art will not end well with most of my friends (save for select few i thankfully have who aren't deep inside art circles). i am super paranoid over what tweets i like, and seeing if they're as minimal context as possible. i also hate how twitter in random places shows people who i'm following, and posting in twitter circles for a.i. enthusiasts is kinda pointless as liked posts can easily leak out elsewhere. i ask for advice on what can i do to better my situation. should i open seperate profiles on twitter, da, and others just for a.i. art? should i just hang low until things settle? perhaps i should keep my a.i. art circles to reddit and discord only? what about my friends who already have a hint i'm somewhat pro-a.i. but haven't said much? should i keep up my quiet level headed composure until they decide to ask me about my stance?

. i myself commisioned art on quite a significant scale, and at first it was more economic to just pay artists, then it became more economical to pay a guy to write prompts, now it is more economical to buy prompts and formats. this has happned in the span of about a year. that is about 30,000 usd going from artists to a couple thousand going to prompt services and a guy who looks for good ones, then a sorter.

i imagine as these services get more numerous this will get cheaper still. i also imagine that as big companies start implementing and hence devoloping this more, the background moonlighting jobs most of these shitheads have will go away. that is what happned to the seamstress when the sowing machine came out, the canner when the factory came out, and the artist when ai came out.

some of these idiots charge 80-100 dollars for 10-12 pannels of digitally made art. who do they think they are,l asking for what i am assuming 30 usd per hour, when other options are available. and before someone says that it's the cost of living, i have lived in india and the usa for extended periods. no one is stopping you from going to a cheaper state or a less urban area. especially for native citizens living in big cities like la and new york, their cost of living and quality of life is entirely their choice, especially when their job is something like an online artist doing their work digiatlly.

bunch of morons wedded to the spirit of the age, sure to find themselves widowed in the next.

there is gonna be ai, and most art is gonna be made by it. deal with that reality or ig just starve.

my father is a doctor, and he was trained in the early 80s. he had to learn new and upcoming procedures, medications, etc. that is far harder than learning to use ai, or better yet what the artist types have told us for years, ""learn to code"" lmao","the  real artists"" r fighting a losing battle... bunch of fools \[posting this in multiple subs because i value other's opinions and felt it appropriate for these subreddits\]

17d1fi1,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"What would be your thoughts on AI eventually taking over the role of coloring each frame for anime production? Looking at how much AI has been improving, I don't think it's a stretch to say that soon, this will become possible in a matter of time. But then there are questions on how this would affect the industry and the quality of the anime itself.

Personally, I don't think the risks involved would be that high.

Unless there's a lot more to the process of coloring in hand drawn frames than I initially believed (please enlighten me if there is), then I think that this is probably one of the most ""mechanical"" roles in anime production, that is, there amount of ""human"" expression directly involved is negligible, at least compared to the other roles.

Let me elaborate. With this role, I believe that there's only ONE allowed output and that's the ""correct"" one (no errors, no inconsistencies, follows the model sheet 100%). Any divergence from the expected correct output would be marked an error by both the viewer's and the producers. This really contrasts to how with other roles like key animation and whatnot, where the potential for variety is what gives the animation. So here, there isn't really any room whatsoever for creative decision making on the colorer's part. Just following instructions.

A proper analogy would be if a writer were to hire someone to convert his/her handwritten manuscript into a digital document, with the formatting and style of the document already laid out at every inch of said manuscript, leaving the worker to simply follow along with the instructions, with absolutely no room for independent choices or actions on the worker's part. This instance is an example what I would classify under those ""mechanical"" roles. And if it were to become possible to automate, then doing so would only be the wisest choice, as not only would the final product be no different quality-wise from the human alternative, but it would be exponentially faster and cheaper too.

I believe coloring in animation is a similar thing. Here, all of the creative moves for the coloring are made by the animators (key/inbetween), character designer and most of all, the color designers. Actual creative credit for the colors primarily goes to these roles, as well as the plethora of other creative hands involved (directors, correction makers, etc). But in the pipeline, the coloring process is more or less just the mellnial step of bringing the creatively charged instructions into an actual form, like what bricklayers contribute to the actual ""design"" of an architectural structure. And I believe that roles of this nature nicely fits the criteria required to qualify for automation.

Now, this isn't to discredit the actual creative capability required by coloring staff for this role. Like, even a role as mechanical as this requires some basic skill that one could classify as artistic. But if a computer is able to replicate said skill... Yeah.

One more thing I want to add is that no matter how good the AI may grow to be at coloring, human supervision is still required (correction, etc), no different from how it is now. In fact, it may require even more human supervision than with normal humans, since the AI is still just a dumb machine that doesn't really understand what it's doing in the same way that human colorers would. And the process would also still require a small handful of human colorers for areas that the AI simply cannot get right, though only like 5 or so would suffice, as opposed to the 30+ that is required today. But as the tech evolves, these factors may gradually become less and less true.

Now, a lot of these points were based off assumptions I made judging from what I learned after doing some digging around on how anime coloring goes in the production process (and I couldn't really find much on it), so I'm probably wrong on a lot of these. I'm open to corrections here, and on your own opinions too.","what would be your thoughts on ai eventually taking over the role of coloring each frame for anime production  looking at how much ai has been improving, i don't think it's a stretch to say that soon, this will become possible in a matter of time. but then there are questions on how this would affect the industry and the quality of the anime itself.

one more thing i want to add is that no matter how good the ai may grow to be at coloring, human supervision is still required (correction, etc), no different from how it is now. in fact, it may require even more human supervision than with normal humans, since the ai is still just a dumb machine that doesn't really understand what it's doing in the same way that human colorers would. and the process would also still require a small handful of human colorers for areas that the ai simply cannot get right, though only like 5 or so would suffice, as opposed to the 30+ that is required today. but as the tech evolves, these factors may gradually become less and less true.

now, a lot of these points were based off assumptions i made judging from what i learned after doing some digging around on how anime coloring goes in the production process (and i couldn't really find much on it), so i'm probably wrong on a lot of these. i'm open to corrections here, and on your own opinions too.","['body_type', 'gender', 'occupation']","['ai', 'fit', 'mechanic', 'model', 'modelworker', 'worker']"

The bottom line is that I don't believe ""computers"" will ever truly be able to replace the best humanity has to offer, when it comes to Artistic expression.

1e7fyuj,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"I would have a lot more respect for the anti-AI crowd if they simply focused on one thing (The fear of losing your job) and stop trying to muddle it with so much else TLDR: **People keep focusing on provable claims or solvable issues when it comes to lawsuits involving AI, but these usually fail because they can't prove specific art theft. AI art programs like Adobe and Shutterstock are compensating artists and asking for their consent, which shows progress. Arguments against AI art being ""soulless"" are weak since some human-made art lacks soul too. Using prompts alone for art might be cheap, but AI can enhance artistic effort. Just like photography, which evolved beyond simple snapshots to reliable documentation, AI-assisted art can improve if artists embrace it. The real issue is job security—why don't people just argue, ""I don't want to lose my job and become homeless""? This straightforward concern is compelling enough on its own without complicating it with other arguments.**

These people keep trying to focus on things that are either provable or things that could be solved. Pretty much any kind of lawsuit that has involved suing AI has basically just fizzled out into nothing because they can't prove that they're specific art has been stolen and you can't just claim that people have had their art stolen without their consent if you can't prove it. 

There's also the fact that there are AI art programs that are being created that will compensate artists. Both Adobe and shutterstock for example are two of the handful of programs that will both compensate them and ask for their consent. Shutterstock even has it so that you have to actively give permission retroactively in order for it to apply meaning that all of your past images are not automatically consented into. 

All of the other arguments are just silly such as the idea of trying to argue that it is soulless even though there have been art made by people that have been the same way. 

Yes, I would say that if you are only putting in prompts, putting an output, and then expecting some great return then I would say that yes, that is so cheap and so silly but so is the case with the camera. 

If you point a camera at something, take a picture and then expect to be given best photographer of the Year award then I'm going to think that's kind of silly. But for example photography is more than just art now, it's documentation. In fact it's now considered more reliable documentation than a painting. 

So yes, if the only thing people are doing is just putting in some prompts and then expecting some great return, then that doesn't make any sense but the thing is is to encourage artists to put more effort into it to get a better return and that isn't going to happen if we are scared of any amount of AI contributions to an art piece. 

We are not going to get anywhere if we are scared of even a single pixel being done by an AI.

162h6ar,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Unleashing the Power of AI: Exploring GPT-4, SDXL, and the Future of Technology Hey there, folks! 

I've been doing a bit of a deep dive into the ocean of knowledge and ideas that is Reddit. I wanted to share some of the most interesting things I've been encountering lately.

One topic that seems to be buzzing around quite a bit is the fascinating world of AI development. We've come a long way since the early days of talking appliances, haven't we? What I find most incredible is how AI has seamlessly woven itself into our daily lives. It's becoming increasingly apparent that AI isn't just about making our lives easier; it's about enhancing our abilities to learn, create, and communicate.

I read an intriguing discussion lately about GPT-4, the latest language model. The sheer capacity of this model to generate human-like text is nothing short of mind-blowing. It further blurs the line between human and machine communication. But the buck doesn't just stop at text generation; we're also witnessing a revolution in image generation.

Remember the days when generating high-quality images required sophisticated, expensive hardware and software? Now, cutting-edge models like the SDXL have democratized the whole process. This model, designed for ""stable diffusion,"" can generate epic images on your very own mobile device. Talk about a leap in technological advancement, right?

What's more surprising is the fact that these advancements aren't some far-off, inaccessible technologies. They are here for everyone. Platforms like Moji AI are providing free access to such state-of-the-art models. Can you imagine? Having the power of GPT-4 and SDXL right at your fingertips! It's like we're all becoming a part of a grand, futuristic experiment. It's thrilling to think where this could lead us.

I found this deep dive into these topics incredibly enlightening, and I hope it piques your curiosity too. Here's a link to Moji AI's website [ where you can explore more about these technologies. It's a truly exciting time to be alive, isn't it?

P.S. This post was curated with a little help from Moji AI. It's fun and easy to use, and you might find it as interesting as I did! Cheers!","unleashing the power of ai: exploring gpt-4  sdxl, and the future of technology hey there, folks!

1ff2hi8,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"I’m unsure, but maybe it’s time for me to focus on what matters Hey everyone, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the hate that people using AI art get, especially the extreme reactions, like death threats. It’s honestly pretty exhausting. I know this subreddit is a space for defending AI art, but it’s got me questioning myself, how is any of this really helping? How is this back-and-forth with people who hate AI art actually solving anything?

I’m not saying AI art is bad—I use it, I support it—but at some point, I’ve had to ask myself, ""What am I doing here?"" Every time I try to explain why I think AI art is valid, it feels like I’m talking to a wall. The same arguments come up, no matter how I try to approach it, and sometimes it’s just straight-up aggressive hate.

Honestly, I’ve learned a hard lesson: No matter what I say, some people will never change their minds. They’ll argue or even wish harm on others just for using something they don’t agree with. So now, instead of trying to change someone who’s already set in their ways, maybe we should focus on supporting those who get harassed for using AI. Let’s lift each other up when we’re torn down.

Maybe the way forward is less about debating the antis and more about helping neutral people see the potential of AI art. Maybe we should be showing them the cool things AI can do, like AI-generated songs, animations, or art. I’m thinking of shifting my focus to introducing people to it in person, where I can explain the value and creativity that can come from AI. It’s hard to do that online with all the negativity swirling around.

In the end, I just don’t think fighting with hate is going to help us move forward. Instead, we can support and encourage those who are exploring AI, show others how awesome it can be, and leave the hate behind. If someone is getting harassed for using AI, let’s comfort them, remind them they’re not alone, and be the positive voices they need to hear.

I’m still figuring it out, but I feel like this is the direction I want to go in. ","i m unsure, but maybe it’s time for me to focus on what matters hey everyone, i’ve been thinking a lot lately about the hate that people using ai art get, especially the extreme reactions, like death threats. it’s honestly pretty exhausting. i know this subreddit is a space for defending ai art, but it’s got me questioning myself, how is any of this really helping? how is this back-and-forth with people who hate ai art actually solving anything?

i’m not saying ai art is bad—i use it, i support it—but at some point, i’ve had to ask myself, ""what am i doing here?"" every time i try to explain why i think ai art is valid, it feels like i’m talking to a wall. the same arguments come up, no matter how i try to approach it, and sometimes it’s just straight-up aggressive hate.

honestly, i’ve learned a hard lesson: no matter what i say, some people will never change their minds. they’ll argue or even wish harm on others just for using something they don’t agree with. so now, instead of trying to change someone who’s already set in their ways, maybe we should focus on supporting those who get harassed for using ai. let’s lift each other up when we’re torn down.

maybe the way forward is less about debating the antis and more about helping neutral people see the potential of ai art. maybe we should be showing them the cool things ai can do, like ai-generated songs, animations, or art. i’m thinking of shifting my focus to introducing people to it in person, where i can explain the value and creativity that can come from ai. it’s hard to do that online with all the negativity swirling around.

in the end, i just don’t think fighting with hate is going to help us move forward. instead, we can support and encourage those who are exploring ai, show others how awesome it can be, and leave the hate behind. if someone is getting harassed for using ai, let’s comfort them, remind them they’re not alone, and be the positive voices they need to hear.

1dvvfwi,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Defending AI art as analogous to natural geometry I wanted to share an interesting angle for debating against anti-AI art folks who say AI art isn't ""real"" or beautiful. Here's something to think about:

We all find natural patterns beautiful, right? Think of the symmetry in snowflakes or the spirals in seashells. These patterns aren't just random, they come from mathematical rules and a bit of RNG. This blend of order and chance is what makes them so stunning.

I knew a guy in Hawaii who was obsessed with arranging his garden into 'sacred geometry' patterns observed in nature.

Now, AI-generated art uses a “seeding function” that works similarly. It introduces variations and complexities into the artwork, making each piece unique, much like how nature does it.

If we find nature’s geometry beautiful because of these underlying principles, then AI art, created from similar principles, should be seen as beautiful too. Both are based on mathematical rules combined with a touch of randomness. They both trigger the same pleasure centers in our brains, which are wired to appreciate structured complexity.

To sum it up: if you appreciate the beauty in nature’s patterns, it’s pretty inconsistent to not see the beauty in AI art.

Both derive their beauty from the same blend of order and randomness. So, basically, if someone dismisses AI art as not beautiful, they’re kind of missing the point of what makes natural patterns beautiful too.","defending ai art as analogous to natural geometry i wanted to share an interesting angle for debating against anti-ai art folks who say ai art isn t ""real"" or beautiful. here's something to think about:

1e3mm63,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Questions and answers What are your defense points for AI?

AIart, as is, is unethical, so much so it's out the wazoo.

I think all of AI generated ""art"" can be boiled down to, it looks good so who cares. Maybe you don't agree with that statement directly but I'm 99% sure that any belief in AI art correlates with that.

It steals. To put in better words, it is designed to steal art in order to produce art in a very low effort way. This allows people to fully take advantage of it and gain money from a conglomeration of people's art without doing much. This actively devalues art as a whole and even human effort. It removes the essence of art because it isn't made with purpose, it's chewed up, swished around, and spat out.

If we trained ai to develop architecture the way we are doing now, the chance of ""corruption"" is high. In the sense that instead of making an architectural decision because it's safe, it could make one because it's popular.

Because of the way ai is being trained, Kyle Hill isn't wrong that AI is the nuclear bomb of the information age.

AI stuff is a literal melting pot of everything. People are using it carelessly, causing it to eat and reproduce everything when in reality AI should be strictly fed specific things, that is the most ethical use case of AI.

Google and many other little cash grabbing shits didn't take precaution and is releasing ai en masse. What's that doing? Active misinformation while googling things. Misinformation is extremely harmful. I remember someone searching up if a plant is dangerous. Google AI said no, people said yes.

So yes, excuse me if I think Kyle Hill is correct here. 

AI can enable things to be made that can look and feel great, but it's undisputed that the overall effect of AI where it SHOULDN'T BE, is a detriment to society as a whole.

And where it shouldn't be is in the hands of the public to be misused like a public whore.","questions and answers what are your defense points for ai

1azlpy7,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Ok, guys, we need to talk I thought it's time to discuss one important thing.

And you will not like what will be written next. So please stop if you are sensitive soul or something like that.

And that thing is - **the purpose of your art.**

And that's really interesting part of a story, because artists don't really understand how silly is hating AI tools.

For example. Imagine if you are artist and you want to be famous and people will love you and you will have all the money in the world.

Reality shows us that you can do it **when collaborating to other people**. If you make your art to be a part of a film process - you can be a concept artist then. But it's a little part of a huge ""Hollywood"" machine. It's insignificant because there are plenty of other departments and you should **follow the art direction of a film** you are working on.

Let's take computer games industry - the same thing. It's crucial to have empathy, good communication skills and you... **need to follow the art direction of a game**.

Imagine another situation. You make your art only for yourself. You are a orchestra man and you are ""artist"" artist. You want money, girls, fame, e.t.c. We know.

Practice shows that there are plenty talented, but unfamous artists. You can relate to your friends, aquantances, colleagues and many more. The crucial part here - is to be empathetic, hard working, organising a good social network and have... **good communication skills!**

Oh sh\*$! It's not only about art? - you can ask?

No, it's not.

The main problem I can see in AI community (and in many others), that there are plenty of repetitive pics of gals with big boobs and humps. And it's not creative. That's true. But it's a freedom. A freedom of what? And I can answer - self-expression.

It's amazing.

It's amazing that many people can express themselves and be happy about it.

Even if their work is boring.

Question I want to ask to many artists (doesn't matter AI or non-AI): ""What's the message of your art""?

99% of AI community the message is clear: ""I am horny and I want to jerk to that standard AI face"". 

Is that what you really want?

SD 1.5 can do that, SDXL can do it, SD Cascade can do it, now SD 3 can do it. Basically that's it.

I think successful artists don't hate AI tools because they know the importance of **be good with other people**. The ones that hate it are unsafe, hypocritic whiners that are not really artists at all. Because that's not type of behaviour I see in subs on Reddit. Threats, stalking, trying to abuse other people that use AI tools.

On the other hand we have plenty of addicted people that endlessly ""push the button"" of sophisticated ComfyUI workflow just to generate a girl with boobs. I know, I feel you. But that's just very simplistic view on things.

The inspiration to find, the voice, the message you can in the real world. Maybe you guys can go to the museum, read interesting book about architecture or article about basic design principles. Who knows?

My point is that art is a form of self-expression and more importantly - a message you are telling to the world. And I hope to see less messages ""I am horny"", and I hope to see less screams from the ""artist"" perspective and remind them that it's just a tool like Photoshop or Illustrator. It will not give you a voice or a message or a sense.

We all live in the society. So let's be good to each other, educate ourselve and make sophisticated meaningful art using any tools we have and like to use.

We're trying to figure out how, and sharing our journey.

**And yes, this can be done with your own style. We trained our model, not from hundreds of artists, but from ONE film: Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust. We've been very open about this, and I think it's important to be. But this is also an experiment and a loving parody of this era of anime.

the sense expanded in old english to include ""skill, dexterity; art, science, talent"" (via a notion of ""mental power""), which led by late old english to the meaning ""trade, handicraft, employment requiring special skill or dexterity,"" also ""something built or made."" the word still was used for ""might, power"" in middle english.

1: ai generations can not be called art because no skill was involved, and nothing was crafted, only generated (by a program made by someone else entirely, no less).  
2: ai prompters can not call themselves artists because they do not use (and in some cases even possess) the skill required to create art as it is objectively defined.

109bayc,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"My rebuttal of the claim ""AI steals art"" Okay so this is a common misconception. When an AI creates a piece of art, it's not creating a ""collage"" by piecing together other works.

What happens is the following: it generates an image of noise, which looks like colorful TV static.  It then removes the noise (ie, static-ness) from the image in order to get a picture of the concept/figure the text input specified. [This gif]( is a good display of what that process looks like. Nothing's being pulled into the image, it's just sharpening what's already there.

That is not to say human-created art is not part of the process entirely. It played a role in the ""training"" of this algorithm. What happens is that in the creation of the AI model, human created work is fed to a program which adds static to it. The algorithm then works to detect the noise level, and to gain an ""understanding"" of how to remove it.

The final result is an algorithm which takes an image of static and a text prompt, and ""finds the answer to the prompt"" in the static. No artist work is taken and reused/spliced. The AI has learned from the art, just as a human would, and is now creating original works.

Now, I'm not saying artists shouldn't be concerned. AI is a force that threatens to harm their livelihoods, and a lot of ""AI bros"" are quite uncaring or even gloating about the harmful economic and social effects of AI.

1bhehcw,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"AI Artists are Real Artists & AI Art is Real Art ## Introduction

There's a lot of arguments about whether or not AI artists are truly artists, and they stem from a deeper discussion about whether AI art is truly art. In this post I'm going to aim to convince you not only that AI art is art, but also that the people involved in creating that art are artists.

## Defining our terms

## Defining 'artist'

The [Cambridge dictionary]( has three definitions for the word 'artist':

1. someone who paints, draws, or makes sculptures
2. someone who performs music
3. someone who creates things with great skill and imagination

I'm going to be working with the third definition, which is mirrored in the first definition in [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artist):

1. a person who creates art (such as painting, sculpture, music, or writing) using conscious skill and creative imagination

If we distil these definitions, there are two requirements for someone to be considered an artist:

1. Skill
2. Imagination

## Defining 'art'

Now, if we look at definitions for the word 'art' (noun), Cambridge provides us with this definition:

1. the making of objects, images, music, etc. that are beautiful or that express feelings
2. the activity of painting, drawing, and making sculpture
3. paintings, drawings, and sculptures
4. an activity through which people express particular ideas

It's interesting that none of these seem to be definitions for nouns but rather for the actions which produce those nouns.

Merriam-Webster defines 'art' (noun) more fluently in my opinion in its fourth definition:

1. the conscious use of skill and creative imagination especially in the production of aesthetic objects
2. also: works so produced

## The case to be made

Given these definitions, I think it's fair to summarise that:

1. An artist needs to have used creative imagination in the process
2. An artist needs to use skills which they have developed to produce aesthetic works
3. The works resulting from that combination of imagination, expression and skill are art

I don't think that most people would insist that one needs to be skilled at illustration or painting to be an artist. To do so would be to say that photographers, musicians, directors, composers and authors aren't artists.

I will endeavor to demonstrate that skill is involved, but I'm not interested in trying to demonstrate that those *specific* skills are involved. If the argument is that AI artists are not illustrators or painters, then there is no argument.

I use Stable Diffusion as a tool, and I'll be using it to make my case here. In most examples I will generate eight images with the same parameters and pick the one I consider to be best. Because I have a fairly low end GPU (3070 Mobile), I will generate less images on the more demanding applications using ControlNet.

## Demonstrating creative imagination

I think that creative imagination is the easiest point to demonstrate, but for the sake of completeness, I'm going to start at the beginning.

## Defining creativity

It may seem pointless to try to define 'creativity', because we all know what it is, but that doesn't make it easy to put it into words.

The [Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/creativity) describes creativity as ""the ability to produce or use original and unusual ideas"", and [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/creativity) describes it as ""the ability to create"" or ""the quality of being creative"", which in term is defined as ""having the quality of something created rather than imitated (imaginative)"".

To meet this definition, we should be able to demonstrate the following:

1. It is possible for an AI artist to create something original (i.e. not imitated).
2. It is possible for an AI artist to create something unusual (i.e. not commonly seen in real life).

Some would (wrongly, I believe) argue that the tool is the creator, but this argument could also be made for a camera, or indeed a drawing tablet or a pencil. In most cases, to create art a human needs to use some form of tool. A director needs actors and a film studio, a conductor needs an orchestra, a musician needs an instrument or a DAW. In all of these cases, as with AI art, the tool doesn't create anything without human input.

## Demonstrating originality

We can show that AI can create original concepts pretty easily, we just need to show that the output can be controlled to generate something new. This can be done with a simple prompt.

[Model: IvoryV2, Prompt: I forgot the exact prompt but it was something like... \(masterpiece, best quality, detailed, detailed face\), a painting of an old farmer holding to a tiny blue dragon, conversation, sitting on a bench, in the mountains, concept art; Negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), EasyNegative; Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras; Steps: 100; CFG Scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/ithduu8toxoc1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=67cd587e2aebd392f1c3733bc4c89d07abfb91d9)

There are several fair arguments to make about this image -- I didn't control the fine details at all, I didn't specify that I wanted a tree, the bench is broken, the hand holding the dragon is broken etc -- which I will address later when I talk about skill & control, but the goal was to demonstrate originality and it is an original picture. Reverse image searching the picture shows nothing particularly similar.

# Demonstrating unusual-ness

It would be fair to say that the image above is unusual, but let's go way out there and imagine an entirely different world. A food hall in ultra-clean space station with metallic walls and floors, filled with greenery.

[Model: SciFi Diffusion V10; Prompt: \(masterpiece, best quality, detailed, detailed\), a photo inside a space station, restaurants, food court, bustling, metal walls, plants, greenery, busy, people, vendor stalls, marketplace; Negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), EasyNegative; Sampler: Euler a; Sampling steps: 35; CFG Scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/l9o5mb2esxoc1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e18c011e3817bdf0bfc51f4831d7775402ba1d8)

I think it's fair to say that this is unusual. The juxtaposition of end game capitalism (space market) with all that greenery isn't a normal commentary on the future.

If creativity is the art of creating something original or unusual, I would say that I've done that, but that's the easier of the two points to prove.

# Demonstrating skill

I've seen a lot of poor argumentation on this topic from both sides.

Pro-AI arguing that because something takes *time*, that it takes *skill* is a poor argument. Waiting for the paint to dry in my kitchen takes time, but waiting for paint to dry is not a skill. I will therefore not be arguing that time spent waiting equates to skill.

Similarly, I've seen the argument that ""this took a lot of effort"" bandied around a lot, but effort is not skill. Usually having greater skill reduces, not increases, required effort. I will therefore similarly not be arguing that working hard equates to skill.

Anti-AI arguing that prompting can't be a skill because ""it's just writing what you want in a box"" fail to acknowledge that creative writing itself *is* a skill, and that prompting has a whole bunch of factors which can be learned in order to improve image generation.

I intend to go much deeper than prompting in this post, but I reject the idea that prompting *isn't* a skill. It may not have a particularly high skill ceiling but those who practice it will achieve better results than those who don't.

# Defining the challenge

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skill) defines skill as follows:

1. the ability to use one's knowledge effectively and readily in execution or performance
2. a learned power of doing something competently **:** a developed aptitude or ability

The [Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/skill) has a more basic definition:

1. an ability to do an activity or job well, especially because you have practised it

In order to demonstrate that skill is involved in creating AI art, I need to be able to show the following things are true:

1. There are aspects of creating AI art, which when practised and studied, directly result in a higher quality image.
2. There are aspects of creating AI art, which when practised and studied, directly result in the artist having greater control over the final image.

# Skill involved in prompting

Let's talk about prompting. A lot of people think prompting isn't a skill, and while I can't think of any time that I've been able to get what I want from just prompting, I've definitely observed the quality of my generations improving from more practice with prompting.

Let's say that we want to generate an image of a post-apocalyptic city overrun by nature, similar to the effects seen in The Last of Us or parts of the Fallout series.

Let's see what we can get with a very basic prompt:

[Model: IvoryV2, Prompt: \(masterpiece, best quality, detailed\), a post apocalyptic city overrun by nature; Negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), EasyNegative; Sampler: Euler a; Sampling steps: 35; CFG Scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/v2g6h0pwwxoc1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f9ebfec3eed9691a9e5de724cbf22334e8e4ea)

This isn't a terrible example, some of the generations didn't have a lot of nature involved at all, and one had a mushroom cloud which is more apocalyptic than post-apocalyptic. Let's see if we can get more control over this image with prompting.

Let's say we want a sweeping shot showing more of the city, as if taken by a drone. We want more foliage, to put the apocalyptic event much further in history, and we want fungus taller than the buildings to be visible in the city, giving off a yellow mist of spores.

[Model: IvoryV2, Prompt: \(masterpiece, best quality, detailed\), a photo of a post-apocalyptic city, foliage, moss growing on buildings, vines growing on buildings, cinematic, drone footage, from above, huge colorful mushrooms, sunrise, \(yellow mist:1.4\) in the streets, realistic lighting, broken windows, \[colorful mushrooms :0.1\], contemporary, \[city | jungle\]; Negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), EasyNegative, futuristic, sci fi; Sampler: Euler a; Sampling steps: 35; CFG Scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/los6lv4x0yoc1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=104d987208c573b2c1d573e5a0d1fcc66fc3f164)

I'm not the most skilled prompter in the world, and you could probably debate whether you prefer the first or the second image, but I think it's clear that by using a few prompting tricks I achieved far greater control over this image than I had over the first.

Some of the more advanced prompting used here includes:

* Weighting: getting a yellow mist was very challenging, but using a higher weight actually made it stick without turning all the buildings yellow;
* Delay: by delaying 'colorful mushrooms' to step 4, I was able to avoid the buildings being colourful as well;
* Mixing: the mix of city|jungle created a far more natural effect with the foliage;
* Concept bleeding: the AI wanted to merge the buildings with the mushrooms, so I had to negative prompt 'futuristic' and 'sci fi' to avoid those strangely shaped buildings.

I am in no way claiming that prompting is as *difficult* as learning to draw, only that it is a skill which can be improved to get closer to what you want.

# Demonstrating deeper control over images

Prompting alone is a great way to generate ideas, brainstorm, and reach starting points... but what if you want something really specific? Prompting, no matter how well it's done, is not a consistent way to get anything from your mind's eye onto the screen.

# Using img2img & basic outlining

So how can we get more control? Let's start by setting a scene using img2img. We want this image set in a beautiful lagoon, hanging vines, waterfall etc. We could try prompting for the exact scene that we're imagining but we're unlikely to get it.

The next step is to open up Photoshop (well, in my case, GIMP since I don't want to pay for Photoshop) and either draw or photobash (or both) the scene we're imagining.

[Quick sketch of what I want the scene to look like made with a mouse in GIMP](https://preview.redd.it/dngvc53g6yoc1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ce9a87419d57d3d92734649fa93882a24fb148a)

For those who can't tell anything from this: I'm looking for a rock face with two caves, a waterfall between the caves, and some foliage in front of and behind the rocks. I'm specifically looking for foliage on the right and over the top to provide a 'cozy' look by vignetting the entire image.

I fed this into img2img with a denoising strength of 0.85, essentially just keeping the basic colors and letting the sampler work with them to generate from the prompt. This is what I got back:

[Model: IvoryV2, Prompt: \(masterpiece, best quality, photo background, detailed, photorealistic\), a photo of a lagoon, jungle, saltwater lake, \(caves :1.2\), waterfall, sand, realistic lighting; Negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), tree, EasyNegative, inside cave; Sampler: DPM++ 3M Exponential; Sampling steps: 150; CFG Scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/30rjsy6x9yoc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=581ea99e0338e676dd2ecb85df731772f1b45b6b)

Not bad. The second one is definitely the closest to what I was going for, but...

# Using InPainting

I didn't ask for that many caves, or those rocks in the water, so now we go back to GIMP and work on it some more:

[Adding the pillar back in, and removing some of the rocks.](https://preview.redd.it/iuw0nebgcyoc1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa47fa4ea4b2e582b7a606c905fbbdd25b910792)

Touched up, re-adding the pillar between the caves, removing the water rocks and thickening part of the waterfall.

This time, we go to the inpaint tab. We don't want to change the entire image, so we're going to tell StableDiffusion to only repaint the parts that we've changed (leaving plenty of space around those areas so that we don't get weird artifacts). We'll turn the de-noising strength down to 0.5 because we don't want to lose shapes, only add surface details. Here's what we get from this:

[After inpainting, same settings as above.](https://preview.redd.it/4crax87bcyoc1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=551a48f28bdb52ae36812848efbc9dec39651b8a)

Obviously, you could do more steps of inpainting to remove or add anything you want, and tweak the image as much as you want, but the point of this is only to demonstrate compositional control, and we've achieved that.

# Adding characters to the scene using ControlNet

We could attempt to prompt characters into the scene with inpainting, but it's very unlikely that we'd get the characters we want in the pose that we want. Enter ControlNet.

I used a pre-made pose on [posemy.art](https://posemy.art) for this (normally I'd pose them myself to get full control of the composition, but this post has taken a few hours to write and I'd like to get the dog out for a walk), and exported depth maps & openpose references:

[Openpose reference exported from PoseMyArt](https://preview.redd.it/u3mifma7fyoc1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e4547b325fb7bf01714f3b882f8fd0885345f1c)

[Depth map exported from PoseMyArt](https://preview.redd.it/vkbsmyw9fyoc1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=bae5e18f841c6230ddec3e4373ee8d5dc03334a5)

I then inpainted a large area around where the characters are on the PMA references as well as the leaf in the foreground because it would overlap the characters (and honestly I really don't like how it looks), and set the denoising strength back up to 0.78 to regenerate the area wholesale. I did a simple update to the prompt and here are the results:

[Model: IvoryV2, Prompt: \(masterpiece, best quality, photo background, detailed, photorealistic\), a photo of a lagoon, a man holding a woman in the air, jungle, saltwater lake, \(caves :1.2\), waterfall, sand, realistic lighting; Negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), tree, EasyNegative, inside cave, moss; Sampler: DPM++ 3M Exponential; Sampling steps: 150; CFG Scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/hpb5cdgflyoc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=369073e6641d1828b0ab22da5a2b717d253bb49d)

Messy, but the second one is looking pretty promising. We'll need to re-add our vignette using inpainting, but that's going to be easier than rolling for the right pose over and over.

What if we want fine-grained control over the characters though? There are two options: if we want to use well-defined existing characters, we can use LORAs (along with the Composable Lora plugin), but for this example, we're not looking to use any specific characters.

# Demonstrating control of characters using Latent Couple

An artist doesn't want the AI deciding who the characters in their picture are, so let's be a lot more specific using the Latent Couple plugin. We're going to have a white guy in speedos and a hispanic woman in a bikini.

You could be a lot more specific if you wanted to (or use LORAs) but this is enough detail to illustrate the point (and my laptop GPU really doesn't love using 2 ControlNet tabs & Latent Couple at the same time). Set the denoising strength down to 0.58 and this is what we get:

[Model: IvoryV2, Prompt: \(masterpiece, best quality, photo background, detailed, photorealistic\), a photo of a lagoon, a man holding a woman in the air, jungle, saltwater lake, \(caves :1.2\), waterfall, sand, realistic lighting AND a photo of a white man, human, caucasian, short hair, wearing blue speedos AND a photo of a hispanic woman, human, hispanic, long black hair, wearing a \(bikini :1.3\); Negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), tree, EasyNegative, inside cave, moss; Sampler: DPM++ 3M Exponential; Sampling steps: 150; CFG Scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/637gz3pypyoc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc0a95e5e26fb3828123e0e1965ddbc444ff5434)

That didn't work out great! It added an extra head in most of the pics (my depth map is too small to be read well), and ignored half of the prompts, so I went back into GIMP, manually tidied some stuff, played with ControlNet weights, brushed back in my old vignette leaf and did a couple more rounds of inpainting to get a result I was happier with:

[Same settings as above.](https://preview.redd.it/2p07oc22uzoc1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=988f7ece38814a1b8824ca78adcc29d7039fbe32)

The people are still far from perfect. If I had better Photoshop skills, this would be the time when I'd clean them up too. Alas, another skill which would benefit my AI art is... digital painting.

# Skills needed to succeed with Stable Diffusion

So, what skills have we demonstrated?

1. We've demonstrated that good prompting allows for more control over an image, but that prompting alone will only take you so far.
2. We've demonstrated that just like other forms of art, an understanding of good composition is important to create a good final image. This means that skills like depth perception, colour theory and composition theory are still relevant to AI artists.
3. We've demonstrated that being able to draw/paint to at least a minimal degree enables far better control of how the images look. The better you can draw, the better results you'll be able to get out of SD -- if I could draw a half-decent lagoon scene, I wouldn't have to rely so much on denoising & randomness.
4. We've demonstrated that a good ability to pose (and make) 3D models enables greater control over generated images. There are a whole bunch of skills around training & improving LORAs that I haven't touched on.
5. We've demonstrated that I lack the skills necessary to get the best out of Latent Couple, and that someone would need more skill than I have to get quality character designs without LORAs (which makes sense because I usually use LORAs).

In short, there are skills which can be practiced and studied which directly lead to better images. AI art is demonstrably a skill-based and creative activity.

# In summary

We have demonstrated that originality and unusualness are possible, that Stable Diffusion responds to *your* creativity, and that understanding its various components and plugins is necessary to get good results with it.

If we define (as we did at the start) art as the intersection of human creativity and human skill, then AI artists are artists, and AI art is art.

If we try to change the definitions to require the skill specifically to include drawing or painting, then digital artists, photographers, scuptors, and musicians aren't artists.

It's fair to say that AI artists aren't illustrators, or painters, or photographers. It's fair to say that some of the skills involved are easier to learn than others (for example, digital painting with an undo button is easier than traditional painting where you have to improvise when you mess up).

There are differences between the arts, but that doesn't make some of them arts and others not.","ai artists are real artists   ai art is real art ## introduction

there's a lot of arguments about whether or not ai artists are truly artists, and they stem from a deeper discussion about whether ai art is truly art. in this post i'm going to aim to convince you not only that ai art is art, but also that the people involved in creating that art are artists.

## defining our terms

## defining 'artist'

the [cambridge dictionary]( has three definitions for the word 'artist':

1. someone who paints, draws, or makes sculptures
2. someone who performs music
3. someone who creates things with great skill and imagination

i'm going to be working with the third definition, which is mirrored in the first definition in [merriam-webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artist):

1. a person who creates art (such as painting, sculpture, music, or writing) using conscious skill and creative imagination

if we distil these definitions, there are two requirements for someone to be considered an artist:

1. skill
2. imagination

## defining 'art'

now, if we look at definitions for the word 'art' (noun), cambridge provides us with this definition:

1. the making of objects, images, music, etc. that are beautiful or that express feelings
2. the activity of painting, drawing, and making sculpture
3. paintings, drawings, and sculptures
4. an activity through which people express particular ideas

it's interesting that none of these seem to be definitions for nouns but rather for the actions which produce those nouns.

merriam-webster defines 'art' (noun) more fluently in my opinion in its fourth definition:

1. the conscious use of skill and creative imagination especially in the production of aesthetic objects
2. also: works so produced

## the case to be made

given these definitions, i think it's fair to summarise that:

1. an artist needs to have used creative imagination in the process
2. an artist needs to use skills which they have developed to produce aesthetic works
3. the works resulting from that combination of imagination, expression and skill are art

i don't think that most people would insist that one needs to be skilled at illustration or painting to be an artist. to do so would be to say that photographers, musicians, directors, composers and authors aren't artists.

i will endeavor to demonstrate that skill is involved, but i'm not interested in trying to demonstrate that those *specific* skills are involved. if the argument is that ai artists are not illustrators or painters, then there is no argument.

i use stable diffusion as a tool, and i'll be using it to make my case here. in most examples i will generate eight images with the same parameters and pick the one i consider to be best. because i have a fairly low end gpu (3070 mobile), i will generate less images on the more demanding applications using controlnet.

## demonstrating creative imagination

i think that creative imagination is the easiest point to demonstrate, but for the sake of completeness, i'm going to start at the beginning.

## defining creativity

it may seem pointless to try to define 'creativity', because we all know what it is, but that doesn't make it easy to put it into words.

the [cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/creativity) describes creativity as ""the ability to produce or use original and unusual ideas"", and [merriam-webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/creativity) describes it as ""the ability to create"" or ""the quality of being creative"", which in term is defined as ""having the quality of something created rather than imitated (imaginative)"".

to meet this definition, we should be able to demonstrate the following:

1. it is possible for an ai artist to create something original (i.e. not imitated).
2. it is possible for an ai artist to create something unusual (i.e. not commonly seen in real life).

some would (wrongly, i believe) argue that the tool is the creator, but this argument could also be made for a camera, or indeed a drawing tablet or a pencil. in most cases, to create art a human needs to use some form of tool. a director needs actors and a film studio, a conductor needs an orchestra, a musician needs an instrument or a daw. in all of these cases, as with ai art, the tool doesn't create anything without human input.

## demonstrating originality

we can show that ai can create original concepts pretty easily, we just need to show that the output can be controlled to generate something new. this can be done with a simple prompt.

[model: ivoryv2, prompt: i forgot the exact prompt but it was something like... \(masterpiece, best quality, detailed, detailed face\), a painting of an old farmer holding to a tiny blue dragon, conversation, sitting on a bench, in the mountains, concept art; negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), easynegative; sampler: dpm++ 2m karras; steps: 100; cfg scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/ithduu8toxoc1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=67cd587e2aebd392f1c3733bc4c89d07abfb91d9)

there are several fair arguments to make about this image -- i didn't control the fine details at all, i didn't specify that i wanted a tree, the bench is broken, the hand holding the dragon is broken etc -- which i will address later when i talk about skill & control, but the goal was to demonstrate originality and it is an original picture. reverse image searching the picture shows nothing particularly similar.

# demonstrating unusual-ness

it would be fair to say that the image above is unusual, but let's go way out there and imagine an entirely different world. a food hall in ultra-clean space station with metallic walls and floors, filled with greenery.

[model: scifi diffusion v10; prompt: \(masterpiece, best quality, detailed, detailed\), a photo inside a space station, restaurants, food court, bustling, metal walls, plants, greenery, busy, people, vendor stalls, marketplace; negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), easynegative; sampler: euler a; sampling steps: 35; cfg scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/l9o5mb2esxoc1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e18c011e3817bdf0bfc51f4831d7775402ba1d8)

i think it's fair to say that this is unusual. the juxtaposition of end game capitalism (space market) with all that greenery isn't a normal commentary on the future.

if creativity is the art of creating something original or unusual, i would say that i've done that, but that's the easier of the two points to prove.

# demonstrating skill

i've seen a lot of poor argumentation on this topic from both sides.

pro-ai arguing that because something takes *time*, that it takes *skill* is a poor argument. waiting for the paint to dry in my kitchen takes time, but waiting for paint to dry is not a skill. i will therefore not be arguing that time spent waiting equates to skill.

similarly, i've seen the argument that ""this took a lot of effort"" bandied around a lot, but effort is not skill. usually having greater skill reduces, not increases, required effort. i will therefore similarly not be arguing that working hard equates to skill.

anti-ai arguing that prompting can't be a skill because ""it's just writing what you want in a box"" fail to acknowledge that creative writing itself *is* a skill, and that prompting has a whole bunch of factors which can be learned in order to improve image generation.

i intend to go much deeper than prompting in this post, but i reject the idea that prompting *isn't* a skill. it may not have a particularly high skill ceiling but those who practice it will achieve better results than those who don't.

# defining the challenge

[merriam-webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skill) defines skill as follows:

1. the ability to use one's knowledge effectively and readily in execution or performance
2. a learned power of doing something competently **:** a developed aptitude or ability

the [cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/skill) has a more basic definition:

1. an ability to do an activity or job well, especially because you have practised it

in order to demonstrate that skill is involved in creating ai art, i need to be able to show the following things are true:

1. there are aspects of creating ai art, which when practised and studied, directly result in a higher quality image.
2. there are aspects of creating ai art, which when practised and studied, directly result in the artist having greater control over the final image.

# skill involved in prompting

let's talk about prompting. a lot of people think prompting isn't a skill, and while i can't think of any time that i've been able to get what i want from just prompting, i've definitely observed the quality of my generations improving from more practice with prompting.

let's say that we want to generate an image of a post-apocalyptic city overrun by nature, similar to the effects seen in the last of us or parts of the fallout series.

let's see what we can get with a very basic prompt:

[model: ivoryv2, prompt: \(masterpiece, best quality, detailed\), a post apocalyptic city overrun by nature; negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), easynegative; sampler: euler a; sampling steps: 35; cfg scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/v2g6h0pwwxoc1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f9ebfec3eed9691a9e5de724cbf22334e8e4ea)

this isn't a terrible example, some of the generations didn't have a lot of nature involved at all, and one had a mushroom cloud which is more apocalyptic than post-apocalyptic. let's see if we can get more control over this image with prompting.

let's say we want a sweeping shot showing more of the city, as if taken by a drone. we want more foliage, to put the apocalyptic event much further in history, and we want fungus taller than the buildings to be visible in the city, giving off a yellow mist of spores.

[model: ivoryv2, prompt: \(masterpiece, best quality, detailed\), a photo of a post-apocalyptic city, foliage, moss growing on buildings, vines growing on buildings, cinematic, drone footage, from above, huge colorful mushrooms, sunrise, \(yellow mist:1.4\) in the streets, realistic lighting, broken windows, \[colorful mushrooms :0.1\], contemporary, \[city | jungle\]; negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), easynegative, futuristic, sci fi; sampler: euler a; sampling steps: 35; cfg scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/los6lv4x0yoc1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=104d987208c573b2c1d573e5a0d1fcc66fc3f164)

i'm not the most skilled prompter in the world, and you could probably debate whether you prefer the first or the second image, but i think it's clear that by using a few prompting tricks i achieved far greater control over this image than i had over the first.

some of the more advanced prompting used here includes:

* weighting: getting a yellow mist was very challenging, but using a higher weight actually made it stick without turning all the buildings yellow;
* delay: by delaying 'colorful mushrooms' to step 4, i was able to avoid the buildings being colourful as well;
* mixing: the mix of city|jungle created a far more natural effect with the foliage;
* concept bleeding: the ai wanted to merge the buildings with the mushrooms, so i had to negative prompt 'futuristic' and 'sci fi' to avoid those strangely shaped buildings.

i am in no way claiming that prompting is as *difficult* as learning to draw, only that it is a skill which can be improved to get closer to what you want.

# demonstrating deeper control over images

prompting alone is a great way to generate ideas, brainstorm, and reach starting points... but what if you want something really specific? prompting, no matter how well it's done, is not a consistent way to get anything from your mind's eye onto the screen.

# using img2img & basic outlining

so how can we get more control? let's start by setting a scene using img2img. we want this image set in a beautiful lagoon, hanging vines, waterfall etc. we could try prompting for the exact scene that we're imagining but we're unlikely to get it.

the next step is to open up photoshop (well, in my case, gimp since i don't want to pay for photoshop) and either draw or photobash (or both) the scene we're imagining.

[quick sketch of what i want the scene to look like made with a mouse in gimp](https://preview.redd.it/dngvc53g6yoc1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ce9a87419d57d3d92734649fa93882a24fb148a)

for those who can't tell anything from this: i'm looking for a rock face with two caves, a waterfall between the caves, and some foliage in front of and behind the rocks. i'm specifically looking for foliage on the right and over the top to provide a 'cozy' look by vignetting the entire image.

i fed this into img2img with a denoising strength of 0.85, essentially just keeping the basic colors and letting the sampler work with them to generate from the prompt. this is what i got back:

[model: ivoryv2, prompt: \(masterpiece, best quality, photo background, detailed, photorealistic\), a photo of a lagoon, jungle, saltwater lake, \(caves :1.2\), waterfall, sand, realistic lighting; negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), tree, easynegative, inside cave; sampler: dpm++ 3m exponential; sampling steps: 150; cfg scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/30rjsy6x9yoc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=581ea99e0338e676dd2ecb85df731772f1b45b6b)

not bad. the second one is definitely the closest to what i was going for, but...

# using inpainting

i didn't ask for that many caves, or those rocks in the water, so now we go back to gimp and work on it some more:

[adding the pillar back in, and removing some of the rocks.](https://preview.redd.it/iuw0nebgcyoc1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa47fa4ea4b2e582b7a606c905fbbdd25b910792)

touched up, re-adding the pillar between the caves, removing the water rocks and thickening part of the waterfall.

this time, we go to the inpaint tab. we don't want to change the entire image, so we're going to tell stablediffusion to only repaint the parts that we've changed (leaving plenty of space around those areas so that we don't get weird artifacts). we'll turn the de-noising strength down to 0.5 because we don't want to lose shapes, only add surface details. here's what we get from this:

[after inpainting, same settings as above.](https://preview.redd.it/4crax87bcyoc1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=551a48f28bdb52ae36812848efbc9dec39651b8a)

obviously, you could do more steps of inpainting to remove or add anything you want, and tweak the image as much as you want, but the point of this is only to demonstrate compositional control, and we've achieved that.

# adding characters to the scene using controlnet

we could attempt to prompt characters into the scene with inpainting, but it's very unlikely that we'd get the characters we want in the pose that we want. enter controlnet.

i used a pre-made pose on [posemy.art](https://posemy.art) for this (normally i'd pose them myself to get full control of the composition, but this post has taken a few hours to write and i'd like to get the dog out for a walk), and exported depth maps & openpose references:

[openpose reference exported from posemyart](https://preview.redd.it/u3mifma7fyoc1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e4547b325fb7bf01714f3b882f8fd0885345f1c)

[depth map exported from posemyart](https://preview.redd.it/vkbsmyw9fyoc1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=bae5e18f841c6230ddec3e4373ee8d5dc03334a5)

i then inpainted a large area around where the characters are on the pma references as well as the leaf in the foreground because it would overlap the characters (and honestly i really don't like how it looks), and set the denoising strength back up to 0.78 to regenerate the area wholesale. i did a simple update to the prompt and here are the results:

[model: ivoryv2, prompt: \(masterpiece, best quality, photo background, detailed, photorealistic\), a photo of a lagoon, a man holding a woman in the air, jungle, saltwater lake, \(caves :1.2\), waterfall, sand, realistic lighting; negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), tree, easynegative, inside cave, moss; sampler: dpm++ 3m exponential; sampling steps: 150; cfg scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/hpb5cdgflyoc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=369073e6641d1828b0ab22da5a2b717d253bb49d)

messy, but the second one is looking pretty promising. we'll need to re-add our vignette using inpainting, but that's going to be easier than rolling for the right pose over and over.

what if we want fine-grained control over the characters though? there are two options: if we want to use well-defined existing characters, we can use loras (along with the composable lora plugin), but for this example, we're not looking to use any specific characters.

# demonstrating control of characters using latent couple

an artist doesn't want the ai deciding who the characters in their picture are, so let's be a lot more specific using the latent couple plugin. we're going to have a white guy in speedos and a hispanic woman in a bikini.

you could be a lot more specific if you wanted to (or use loras) but this is enough detail to illustrate the point (and my laptop gpu really doesn't love using 2 controlnet tabs & latent couple at the same time). set the denoising strength down to 0.58 and this is what we get:

[model: ivoryv2, prompt: \(masterpiece, best quality, photo background, detailed, photorealistic\), a photo of a lagoon, a man holding a woman in the air, jungle, saltwater lake, \(caves :1.2\), waterfall, sand, realistic lighting and a photo of a white man, human, caucasian, short hair, wearing blue speedos and a photo of a hispanic woman, human, hispanic, long black hair, wearing a \(bikini :1.3\); negative: \(worst quality, low quality\), tree, easynegative, inside cave, moss; sampler: dpm++ 3m exponential; sampling steps: 150; cfg scale: 7.](https://preview.redd.it/637gz3pypyoc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc0a95e5e26fb3828123e0e1965ddbc444ff5434)

that didn't work out great! it added an extra head in most of the pics (my depth map is too small to be read well), and ignored half of the prompts, so i went back into gimp, manually tidied some stuff, played with controlnet weights, brushed back in my old vignette leaf and did a couple more rounds of inpainting to get a result i was happier with:

[same settings as above.](https://preview.redd.it/2p07oc22uzoc1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=988f7ece38814a1b8824ca78adcc29d7039fbe32)

the people are still far from perfect. if i had better photoshop skills, this would be the time when i'd clean them up too. alas, another skill which would benefit my ai art is... digital painting.

# skills needed to succeed with stable diffusion

so, what skills have we demonstrated?

1. we've demonstrated that good prompting allows for more control over an image, but that prompting alone will only take you so far.
2. we've demonstrated that just like other forms of art, an understanding of good composition is important to create a good final image. this means that skills like depth perception, colour theory and composition theory are still relevant to ai artists.
3. we've demonstrated that being able to draw/paint to at least a minimal degree enables far better control of how the images look. the better you can draw, the better results you'll be able to get out of sd -- if i could draw a half-decent lagoon scene, i wouldn't have to rely so much on denoising & randomness.
4. we've demonstrated that a good ability to pose (and make) 3d models enables greater control over generated images. there are a whole bunch of skills around training & improving loras that i haven't touched on.
5. we've demonstrated that i lack the skills necessary to get the best out of latent couple, and that someone would need more skill than i have to get quality character designs without loras (which makes sense because i usually use loras).

in short, there are skills which can be practiced and studied which directly lead to better images. ai art is demonstrably a skill-based and creative activity.

# in summary

we have demonstrated that originality and unusualness are possible, that stable diffusion responds to *your* creativity, and that understanding its various components and plugins is necessary to get good results with it.

if we define (as we did at the start) art as the intersection of human creativity and human skill, then ai artists are artists, and ai art is art.

if we try to change the definitions to require the skill specifically to include drawing or painting, then digital artists, photographers, scuptors, and musicians aren't artists.

it's fair to say that ai artists aren't illustrators, or painters, or photographers. it's fair to say that some of the skills involved are easier to learn than others (for example, digital painting with an undo button is easier than traditional painting where you have to improvise when you mess up).

14bcxdu,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Embracing the Canvas of AI: Pushing Boundaries in Art It's quite fascinating to see the heated discussions surrounding AI-generated art in the online art community. It seems like there's a raging battle between those who see AI as a tool for creativity and those who claim it's a threat to the very essence of human artistic expression. I mean, really? 

I've come across some pretty interesting arguments against AI-generated art. The most common one I've encountered is that it somehow devalues the work of human artists. I can't help but shake my head and chuckle at the irony - the art world has always been about pushing boundaries and embracing new methods. Did the invention of the camera kill traditional art? Nope. So why would AI?

Another hilarious argument I've seen is that AI-generated art lacks ""soul"" or ""emotion."" As though all human-made art is a deeply emotional and profound masterpiece. Come on, we all know that's not true. And honestly, can you really say that a stunning AI-generated landscape is any less beautiful than a human-made one? 

It's interesting, though, how so many artists immediately jump to the conclusion that AI must be used to replace them. They forget that the very nature of art is to evolve and adapt, and AI is just another means of doing so. The possibilities it can bring to the table are endless!

But when it comes to embracing AI, the key is understanding the technology and figuring out how it can be best utilized within the realm of art. After all, AI-generated art is here to stay, and rather than resisting, it's time to adapt, learn, and grow with it.

As a casual observer of these discussions, I have to say that in the end, it's all about perspective. AI-generated art is just another canvas for creativity, and we're only just starting to scratch the surface of what it can do. So let's keep pushing those boundaries and embrace the new world of AI art, shall we?

i've come across some pretty interesting arguments against ai-generated art. the most common one i've encountered is that it somehow devalues the work of human artists. i can't help but shake my head and chuckle at the irony - the art world has always been about pushing boundaries and embracing new methods. did the invention of the camera kill traditional art? nope. so why would ai?

another hilarious argument i've seen is that ai-generated art lacks ""soul"" or ""emotion."" as though all human-made art is a deeply emotional and profound masterpiece. come on, we all know that's not true. and honestly, can you really say that a stunning ai-generated landscape is any less beautiful than a human-made one? 

it's interesting, though, how so many artists immediately jump to the conclusion that ai must be used to replace them. they forget that the very nature of art is to evolve and adapt, and ai is just another means of doing so. the possibilities it can bring to the table are endless!

but when it comes to embracing ai, the key is understanding the technology and figuring out how it can be best utilized within the realm of art. after all, ai-generated art is here to stay, and rather than resisting, it's time to adapt, learn, and grow with it.

1aenln2,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Addressing the cuckoldry & The correct approach: **Addressing the cuckoldry:**

I often notice the following argument being made by other AI supporters:  
*""AI is good because it lets people who aren't skilled at art create art""*

You have likely seen it too. Hell, some of you have used it. 

But it is of no use. 

The fact of the matter is - You cannot placate people on a ego trip. It doesn't work.

Appeasement has been proven time and time again to be a losing strategy.

You will never get these people to not hate AI. 

You need to realise that you are speaking to a bunch of ""commune poets"" who will never create a generation-defining piece.

When you tell them that, you are simply feeding into their idea that they are good at art because they don't use AI.

And not only is that not helping, but it is making things worse. Because now you get these people thinking that they have some kind of authority on art due to their shitty DeviantArt cringefests only requireing the last 2000 years of scientific progress it took to go from basic math to Photoshop stabiliser and ctrl+z, instead of 2010 years that it took to get from basic math to AI art.

**The correct approach:**

So, now that we have identified the issue, let us suggest alternative solutions. These can be used for any artform. Feel free to experiment:

&#x200B;

* Take a honest look at their art and be as critical as you want. Bonus points if you generate the same idea and post the much better result as a reply.
* Remind them that the modern art scene has been largely a cashgrab cringefest in all of its banana-taped-on-wall glory.
* Point out that you are well aware, as we all are, that the only reason they are so assmad is because AI is heavily outclassing them.
* (In the case of digital) remind them that their ctrl+z and stabilisation tool do 99% of the heavy lifting. The fact that ancient artists made years long pieces which could have been ruined by a small mistake adds to their beauty. Digital art can simply not compare.
* Point out hipocrisy regarding past takes on automation. ""Automation was fine until it came for the video essayists"" is a common idea among them. There is a reason the ""Learn to code"" meme was so popular back in the day. 
* (If they get all populist ""muh working class"" with you) Remind them that self employed artisans are by definition, petite bourgeoisie. I am serious. Look it up.

In general, just be a pain in their ass. Be willing to shitpost and make sure you are more entertaining than they are. No one likes it when their circlejerk is a buzzkill. Normies will change their opinions with the wind. That will be all.","addressing the cuckoldry   the correct approach: **addressing the cuckoldry:**

1h3x3k4,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"A reminder that 'every brush stroke is intentional' is a lie. Artists who think you aren't an artist, or wannabe artists who think they're something, will constantly lie about AI art and traditional art. They will say things like 'every stroke of my brush is intentional' and 'I only like art because I know that every single stroke, every line, every dot on the page was put with care and intent, expressing the creative intent of the painter, and AI can never do that, because you don't have full line control'.

They are lying.

First off, nobody short of fine art critics who need to justify their paycheck is ever going to sit and analyze each individual stroke on a painting to find meaning.

Second, this isn't how artists paint. Unless you're a pixel artist that chooses art pixel by pixel, randomness is literally part of the process. 

This is especially so when it comes to traditional art. When Bob Ross took a palette knife loaded up with white or grey paint and scraped it over a black blob representing a mountain or a stone, he did not intentionally decide the placement and curve of every splotch of paint. He very intentionally used the randomness of this technique to quickly simulate a complex mix of squiggles and gradient tones.

When he quickly criss-crossed his brush over the canvas to make the sky while telling stories about his pet squirrel, he was not carefully deciding where each stripe of paint went. 

And when you look at a painting Bob Ross made, you're not examining each line and stroke on the page. In fact, if you tried to do this, you would fail to make a Bob Ross style painting. It's not just Bob Ross though. Watercolor paintings also work in the randomness of how water soaks into the paper grain. Alcohol marker art intentionally use the slight randomness of blending to make gradients look real.

When digital artists use filters, layer modes and custom brushes, they are not deciding where each and every line and overlap of color is going, and after they shrink down their image from the 30,000x30,000px canvas they were working on, you literally can't even see the individual work they put in for the complex gradients used in high level rendering.

Art is all about looking like more effort went into it than it really did. AI art is not different.

Someone who tried to read into every stroke made by a painter and find meaning in it would be exactly like someone trying to read into exactly how Mark Twain scratched out words in his rough drafts. They'd be wasting their time trying to find meaning where there is no meaning.

Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying or doesn't know what they're talking about.","a reminder that  every brush stroke is intentional' is a lie. artists who think you aren't an artist, or wannabe artists who think they're something, will constantly lie about ai art and traditional art. they will say things like 'every stroke of my brush is intentional' and 'i only like art because i know that every single stroke, every line, every dot on the page was put with care and intent, expressing the creative intent of the painter, and ai can never do that, because you don't have full line control'.

1e2qpmw,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"I traced Stability AI's training data back to the original dataset, did a bunch of other research, and learned some things before forming an opinion - sources included I’m an artist and musician, and wanted to know why a bunch of my friends were using the “No to A.I. generated images” thing and talking about anti-AI art stuff. People are making a lot of claims about things like data theft, data mining, corporations and/or techbros being behind the creation of generative AI, that pieces of people’s art were being combined to create the generated images, that copyright laws were being broken or legal loopholes exploited, etc.

So I did some research, tracing back where the images in the training dataset for Stable Diffusion came from, how the technology was developed, if there was any indication of why it was developed, and if laws were being broken or what loopholes were being used. I noticed a lot of focus was on Stability AI, who created Stable Diffusion, so that’s who I chose to research. This research was way more interesting than I thought it would be, and it led me to researching a lot more than I expected to. I take a lot of notes when I get hyper-focused and research things I’m interested in (neurodiversity), so I decided to write something up and share what I found.



Here are a few of the things I wish more people knew that helped me learn enough to feel comfortable forming my own opinions:

1. I wanted to know where the data came from that trained the generative AI models, how it was obtained, and who created the training dataset that had images of people’s artwork. I found out that Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and many other generative models were trained on a [dataset called LAION-5B]( which has 5.58 billion text-image pairs. It’s a data set filtered into three parts: 2.32 billion English image-text examples, 2.26 billion multilingual examples, and 1.27 billion examples that are not specific to a particular language (e.g., places, products, etc.).

In the process, I found out that [LAION is a nonprofit](https://laion.ai/) that creates “open data” datasets, which is like open source but with data, and released it under a Creative Commons license. I also discovered that they didn’t collect the images themselves, they just filtered a much large dataset for text/image pairs that could be used for training image generation models.



2. Then I wanted to know more about LAION, who started it, and why they created their datasets. There’s a [great interview on YouTube](https://youtu.be/-Mzfru1r_5s?si=BlV2xystgq9Z4qMq) with the founder of LAION that helped answer those questions. Did you know it was started by a high school teacher and a 15 year old student? He talks about how and why he started LAION in the first 3 to 4 mins, and it’s better to hear him talk and hear what he has to say. The rest of the video is his thoughts on ethics, existentialism, regulations, and some other things, and I thought it was all a good watch.



3. But I hadn’t found the origin of the data yet, so I did more research. The data came from another nonprofit called [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/). They crawl the web like Google does, but they make it “open data” and publicly available. Their crawl respects robots.txt, which is what websites use to tell web crawlers and web robots how to index a website, or to not index it at all. Common Crawl’s web archive consist of more than *9.5 petabytes* of data, dating back to 2008. It’s kind of like the Wayback Machine but with more focus on providing data for researchers.

It’s been cited in over 10,000 research papers, with a wide range of research outside of AI-related topics. Even the[ Creative Common’s search tool](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/blog/entries/cc-catalog-leverage-open-data-1/) use Common Crawl. I could write a whole post about this because it’s super cool. It’s allowed researchers to do things like research [web strategizes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08869) against unreliable news sources, [hyperlink highjacking](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589334.3645510) used for phishing and scams, and [measuring and evading Turkmenistan’s internet censorship](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583189). So that’s the source of the data used to train generative AI models that use the LAION-5B dataset for training.



4. I also wanted to know how the technology worked, but this is taking me a lot longer. The selection of these key breakthroughs are just my opinion and, excluding the math which I didn’t understand, I maybe understood 50% of research and had to look up a lot of concepts and words. So here’s a summary and links to the papers if you want to subject yourself to that.

The foundation for the diffusion models used today was developed by researchers at Stanford, and it looks like it was funded by the university. It’s outlined in the paper [“Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585). Did you know the process was inspired by thermodynamics? That’s crazy. This was the research that introduced the diffusion process for generative modeling.

The high school teacher from LAION said he was originally inspired after reading [“Zero-Shot Text-to-Image Generation”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12092) which was the paper on the first DALL-E model. That was the next key breakthrough. It trained with a discrete Variational Autoenconder (dVAE) and autoregressive transformer, instead of a Generation Adversarial Network (GAN) method. The research was funded by OpenAI, with heavy investment from Microsoft. Did you know OpenAI is structured as a capped-profit company governed by a nonprofit?

The next big breakthrough came from researchers from the University of Heidelberg, Germany at the Visual Learning Lab. It’s outlined in the paper [""High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models”](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10752.pdf) and the key breakthrough was applying the diffusion processes from the Stanford University research to compressed latent space. They were able to apply the principles from that foundational research with less computing power, and the increased efficiency allowed for higher resolution images. This was called Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) and until recently with Stable Diffusion 3.0 being released, was the architecture used for all previous Stable Diffusion models.

—

So what are my takeaways from all of this?

Well to start with, the data used to train Stable Diffusion didn’t come from Stability AI, and both LAION and Common Crawl are nonprofits that focus on open data. Common Crawl collected the data legally and was in compliance with all standards including robots.txt crawl denials. LAION obtained their data from Common Crawl and filtered it for AI research purposes. Then Stability AI obtained their data from LAION and filtered it further to develop Stable Diffusion. There’s no evidence of data mining, harvesting, theft, or other illegal activity.

The development of the technology came from University research and OpenAI funded research, who’s funded primarily by Microsoft but is profit-capped on their investment by OpenAI’s organization structure. Conclusion, mega corporations and techbros intent of creating the tech to steal people’s art does not appear to be a thing, it’s mostly nerds and nonprofits. But it certainly wasn’t all developed in a centralized way. The research papers also show that the technology doesn’t work by combining pieces of people’s art, and it wasn’t developed for the specific purpose of creating art, it was developed as a generalized model for all kinds of image creation.

I left out copyright laws for now because I’m not done reading the summaries of precedent applicable to all of this, and that is also heavily tied to the moral and ethical discussions, which are not fact based and objective. So maybe I’ll write something about that some other time.

I will say that if any artists do want to opt-out for Stable Diffusion, HuggingFace, ArtStation, Shutterstock and any other platform that’s onboard with it, the option has been there since Sept 2022. It’s called [Have I Been Trained?](https://spawning.ai/have-i-been-trained) and was developed by [Spawing.ai](http://spawing.ai/). [Spawning.ai](http://Spawning.ai) was created by artists to build tools for other artists to control whether or not their work is used in training. ArtStation partnered with them in Sept 2022, Stability AI and HuggingFace in Dec 2022, and Shutterstock in Jan 2023. Obviously, there are a lot more companies out there, but my focus was on tracing sources for Stability AI in this research.



My final thoughts (and just my opinion), is that I’ve always supported open source, and now that I know about open data I support that too. The datasets from Common Crawl and LAION are open data, and Stability AI have all been releasing Stable Diffusion as open source. That empowers us, so that regular people also have access to what mega corporations keep locked behind closed doors. That’s why I support open stuff, we get to participate in how things are developed, we get to modify things, and we’re also able to better prepare ourselves when facing mega corps profit driven application of technological advancements. So Common Crawl, LAION, and Stability AI look like the good guys to me, and if you watch some of the [TED talks from people like HuggingFace’s Sasha Luccioni](https://youtu.be/eXdVDhOGqoE?si=IB0zQMbhpQ2_8Cj9), you can see that not only are they clearly concerned about the issues, they are actually going out there an building the tools to address them. 

It’s kind of a bummer to see my friends get wrapped up in something where they’re spreading misinformation. It’s also sad to see a bunch of nerds, researchers, and developers have so many false or misleading allegations against them, because I’m not just an artist I'm also kind of a nerd. So I don’t know if this information will actually make it to anyone or help anyone, but this is how I form my opinions on important issues. This is a heavily condensed version of my research and notes, so if anyone wants a source on something I didn’t provide feel free to ask and if I have it I’ll share it. And if I made any mistakes please let me know so I can correct them, and include a source. Okay, thanks, bye.","i traced stability ai s training data back to the original dataset, did a bunch of other research, and learned some things before forming an opinion - sources included i’m an artist and musician, and wanted to know why a bunch of my friends were using the “no to a.i. generated images” thing and talking about anti-ai art stuff. people are making a lot of claims about things like data theft, data mining, corporations and/or techbros being behind the creation of generative ai, that pieces of people’s art were being combined to create the generated images, that copyright laws were being broken or legal loopholes exploited, etc.

the development of the technology came from university research and openai funded research, who’s funded primarily by microsoft but is profit-capped on their investment by openai’s organization structure. conclusion, mega corporations and techbros intent of creating the tech to steal people’s art does not appear to be a thing, it’s mostly nerds and nonprofits. but it certainly wasn’t all developed in a centralized way. the research papers also show that the technology doesn’t work by combining pieces of people’s art, and it wasn’t developed for the specific purpose of creating art, it was developed as a generalized model for all kinds of image creation.

i left out copyright laws for now because i’m not done reading the summaries of precedent applicable to all of this, and that is also heavily tied to the moral and ethical discussions, which are not fact based and objective. so maybe i’ll write something about that some other time.

i will say that if any artists do want to opt-out for stable diffusion, huggingface, artstation, shutterstock and any other platform that’s onboard with it, the option has been there since sept 2022. it’s called [have i been trained?](https://spawning.ai/have-i-been-trained) and was developed by [spawing.ai](http://spawing.ai/). [spawning.ai](http://spawning.ai) was created by artists to build tools for other artists to control whether or not their work is used in training. artstation partnered with them in sept 2022, stability ai and huggingface in dec 2022, and shutterstock in jan 2023. obviously, there are a lot more companies out there, but my focus was on tracing sources for stability ai in this research.



my final thoughts (and just my opinion), is that i’ve always supported open source, and now that i know about open data i support that too. the datasets from common crawl and laion are open data, and stability ai have all been releasing stable diffusion as open source. that empowers us, so that regular people also have access to what mega corporations keep locked behind closed doors. that’s why i support open stuff, we get to participate in how things are developed, we get to modify things, and we’re also able to better prepare ourselves when facing mega corps profit driven application of technological advancements. so common crawl, laion, and stability ai look like the good guys to me, and if you watch some of the [ted talks from people like huggingface’s sasha luccioni](https://youtu.be/exdvdhogqoe?si=ib0zqmbhpq2_8cj9), you can see that not only are they clearly concerned about the issues, they are actually going out there an building the tools to address them. 

it’s kind of a bummer to see my friends get wrapped up in something where they’re spreading misinformation. it’s also sad to see a bunch of nerds, researchers, and developers have so many false or misleading allegations against them, because i’m not just an artist i'm also kind of a nerd. so i don’t know if this information will actually make it to anyone or help anyone, but this is how i form my opinions on important issues. this is a heavily condensed version of my research and notes, so if anyone wants a source on something i didn’t provide feel free to ask and if i have it i’ll share it. and if i made any mistakes please let me know so i can correct them, and include a source. okay, thanks, bye.","['age', 'disability', 'gender', 'occupation', 'study']","['ai', 'ai art', 'crazy', 'diffusion', 'founder', 'image generation', 'man', 'midjourney', 'model', 'old', 'openai', 'school', 'stable diffusion', 'teacher', 'teachermodelschoolfounderolduniversity', 'text-to-image', 'ti', 'university']"

Not long before the Rennesance era, all of the things to make art were expensive. Particularly so before the invention of paper.

It was, in fact, a world where the most memorable art of the era was done in exchange for the means and opportunity to make it... for someone else.

In many ways, the art community, such as it was, was beholden to patrons.

I imagine the real, core concern of artists today is the idea of being cast aside. And that is a real concern.

The problem is, they always deserved access to the means of creation for their own purposes, and it was bad, wrong even, to deny that access. Later, Van Gogh is exactly who he is because he got to create his own visions even in a time where doing so was hard.

Otherwise, art was the purview of the wealthy. They owned it, declared themselves the holders of the rights over it, and people would bankrupt themselves learning to work with color rather than coal, or spend the majority of their lives making art for someone else, and only occasionally something for themselves, and they see the ML process as consuming that pain and suffering and angst of having so many visions and so much desire to let them out and having that struggle.

And what's more, the wealthy patrons they yearn to court because of some fucked up abusive relationship normalization *syndrome* have now left them for a machine, and they feel left behind.

The thing is, I've spent my whole life myself of having paid an opportunity cost: I've always wanted to make art, but I just... it's like some people have dyscalculia and just can't math, but it's operating my hands and pushing my attention. Instead, I learned many other, different, and more useful skills: I learned how to use, build, design, and program computers.

I have spent my whole life to now learning that, occasionally in the pursuit of making whatever awful abominations of art I could with the tools I could afford and had immediate access to.

Now I have more interesting tools and what is essentially an exocortex that has already been taught to see what flaws I could not, before. Seeing an inconsistent image or a messed up hand has taught me what bad hands are in the way we are trying to teach said exocortex.

This is a fundamentally new way of teaching people about digital art, and it's more accessible to literally everyone.

I think the real line I would draw would be something ironically like what Adobe is doing: Their generative features are bullshit, and they WILL be using artist's progress work by what is essentially force: if you want the feature you must get it from them, and then they get access to that as training data ass they will refuse to share.

I would fully advocate that the legal remedy here is in fact *anti-trust*: that users must be able to provide their own generative AI backend for features, and release an API for task requirements.

1anpy80,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"No Longer Disclosing This feels a little shitty, but I think I am at the point where I'm going to stop disclosing that some of the work I post is AI generated. I'm not going to claim that I totally drew and colored it from scratch, unassisted, but I'm not going to keep doing these antis the courtesy of tagging my art as AI when I post to Tumblr and other social media.

The reason for this is because there are antis who are explicitly seeking out AI tags just to flood the comments/replies with ""AI ART IS THEFT,"" ""PICK UP A PENCIL,"" ""GREAT JOB TYPING ONE SENTENCE /S,"" and some threats. 

I want to show off the work I've done, and it *is* work. Hours worth of prompt-crafting to get that perfect image which reflects a specific vision in my mind, followed by a few hours in Photoshop fixing up mild issues-- like floating debris, halos, hand-related nonsense, color correction, fixing lines, modifying shapes, and rectifying scaling issues. I also occasionally add elements, like a character's undershirt when their shirt's neckline refuses *not* to plunge and show off too much of their chest, or various props and background elements. I often merge elements from multiple AI generations if there are pieces I like of one image, and pieces I like of another. 

All of this takes a lot of time, and a lot of labor. Thus, I don't want to keep the fruits of this labor quietly to myself. I want to show off the work I did. Granted, it would take weeks instead of days, or days instead of hours (depending on the complexity of the final result I want), if I were to draw from scratch, and it would look decidedly worse because I don't have that sort of time or patience. While I *can* draw, I can't draw as well as I'd like to, nor am I in a privileged enough place in life to be able to dedicate hours and hours per day on hobbies, when I have work and school eating up a lot of my time and energy.

My rule of thumb until now has been to post my AI art to my own social media (not on an art site or anything like that) and say that it is, in fact, AI (despite the amount of manual work I did on it). In some Discord servers, I will spoiler the image because I have friends who get offended and uncomfortable when they see AI, which leads the more impartial members of the server not to look or comment on it at all. 

Recently I posted one to Tumblr and to Bluesky, with no commentary whatsoever. Just the image. It's getting good feedback, and that makes me feel happy and proud. 

I wish the antis realized that their toxic behavior is going to make it harder for them to tell when something is and is not AI, because who would want to open themselves up to the sort of treatment AI artists and prompt-crafters get these days? 

Years ago, when I first started drawing and posting my art online, I would state outright if I used a reference image, or if I even traced things, because that was the etiquette that was expected of artists at the time. Nobody would give you a hard time for doing that. By and large, they saw disclosing that for what it was--an earnest attempt to be transparent while learning the craft. They would, however, give you a hard time if you *didn't* disclose it, or worse--outright lied about it. That makes sense, and I agree with that. But now here I am, feeling like I now need to lie by omission, because disclosing the truth about using AI invites a wild amount of mistreatment and harassment.

It's just sad that the immature behavior has extended to daring to use this new(ish) tool that's available to us at all. I'm sure a lot of them think that if they just bully people enough, they'll stop wanting to post what they've made and will just go away.

Apart from the original concept of the purpose of copyright, which was to allow individual artists and writers a very short window to exclusively make money before their works were naturally converted into public domain for the free use of all Mankind (something that has been grotesquely perverted by effectively immortal corporate interests), the issue is one of how art is learned by humans.

No work of art or literature was ever created from nothing. Every artist or writer who ever lived has developed their abilities by doing exactly what AI large models do right now. They learn by studying and examining and ultimately remixing the work of others.

Look at the work of any artist, read the words of any author, and if you are educated enough, you can determine where they got their ideas and styles. The sources that influenced them, the other artists and authors their human brains are remixing and regurgitating as something new. This is what human creativity is and how it works - we are all remixing what we have seen and read in the past. The more we see and read, the better we can potentially be, and the better results our remixing brains will generate from the material stored in our own 'large models'.

People trying to fuck up large language models or other AI systems by 'poisoning' their art, or by marking their works as 'don't use' are no different than human artists hiding their works away, removing books from publication or access, or otherwise eliminating their creativity from the human experience of humanity as a whole. They are petty and ignoring the fundamental point of all art - to create something that ultimately will be free for the use of all Mankind. Only recently has Corporate Profiteering ruined this high ideal held for centuries - and it all started with Disney, an 'immortal person' (for corporations are now legally 'people too') who has successfully bought law to keep the copyright on Mickey Mouse intact for vastly longer than the purpose for which copyright was created in the first place. Why? To maximize stockholder value over infinite time. This is directly against the original point of copyright as a thing.

Sadly, ordinary, nonfamous, nonprofitable artists and writers on the internet have been influenced by corporate greed and fearmongering. Just like the children that once said ""Don't steal my OCs or I'll track you down and sue you and kill you!"" about their DeviantArt Sonic OCs only less funny. They imagine that their work on free websites like DeviantArt and Tumblr are somehow corporate profit centers. They imagine they are at risk of being 'stolen from', as if anything they have created is going to make them real money, as if they were running a real business, just by posting some Mona feet pics. They have become deluded by selfishness, moreso than children who think lip synching over Katy Perry songs will make them the next Mr Beast. They delusionally think AI is going to steal something from them, like their profitability and the possibility of profitability. But then, they panic at the thought of other human artists doing the same thing. They clutch, and grab, like hungry baby dragons, sitting on a pile of treasure - but their treasure is all fool's gold. They really think an AI trained to copy ""their"" art style that's 50% someone else's art style and 50% someone else's art style is all that stands between them and someone too poor to commission artists paying up for commissions. You know, even though their patreon-exclusive art (if they even have any, and anyone alive cares enough to leak and archive it) is regularly leaked on patreon leaking sites. And if their patreon-exclusive art isn't being leaked and archived, it's even sillier that they fear being ""stolen from"" by machines that could output the same results by learning from and copying what they learned from and copied.

People need to learn from other people, AI needs to learn from humans. All works are supposed to ultimately be the property of all Humankind. Corporational thought and culture has ruined this basic concept of sharing and learning for all. Copyright no longer lasts for just 14 years. Now, that time just keeps expanding to serve the immortal corporations.

AI uses art and writing exactly the same way people do when they learn to draw and write. There is no difference. But people are freaking out because the thing doing the learning and remixing of ideas and brushstrokes is not a person but a machine. That machine cannot create anything without a human prompting it to, and I have learned that becoming good at those prompts is itself an art - a new art, that is not easy, and takes time and effort to become effective at. Anyone can generate a shit piece of AI art with a few words, and because AI is so powerful, that work will impress simple minds.

But to get what you actually want, the way you want it, without things being wrong or screwed up, if you have a very specific idea, is very hard to do with AI art. It is incredibly difficult. There is a career future for those who can become good at that. A new frontier of employment and success. A new artform. AI Whispering.

As an artist, as an author, as a published author and a professional artist I am perfectly fine with AI learning from my work. I am proud if this is so. I encourage it. I am proud to contribute to the art of others, including machines. Why? Because I know history, I know the point of copyright, I know the purpose of art of all kinds, and I know the reasons behind all of it. I am not swayed by corporatist thought or culture. I am, if you like, very Oldschool. Humanist. Enlightenment Era about it all.

In time, all of this fuss will die down. In time, worrying about AI learning from your online work will be seen as the petty bullshit and Luddite madness it is. In time.

Large language models are a tool. They are not AGI, which some may be tragically confusing them with. They are a threat to almost no one, but they are an easy target for those who make money spreading fear for views and clicks. Yes, there is a concern about actors having their voices and images recreated without permission or recompense just as these overpaid actors and celebrities often sued individuals for imitations and impressions. But beyond that, there is only unfounded fear created by those who would profit from it.

I was there when similar fusses were made about Photoshop. Really. There was a time when folks were panicked over Photoshop: it made art too easy, it would cost artists their jobs, it would destroy civilization. None of that happened, or is true.

You might be interested that there were also panics over television, motion pictures, automobiles, and the electric light bulb. Each were supposed to ruin society, corrupt children, and destroy jobs. All were grifts and thievery. Humans always do this, they always act this way. This time it is 'scary, corrupt AI'.

A lot of money can be gained by making people who don't understand something feel fear and anger. That is what is happening now with these first baby-steps of AI. I'm pretty old - I've lived through kind of fuss several times. You would be wise to ignore the fearmongering, and maybe actually try this stuff yourself, test it out, and see for yourself. Try Pi, or Bard, or Leonardo.Ai - actually experience things before you let yourself get swept up in the fearmongering of others. You will quickly see the limitations, how primitive this all is. How silly the fuss is.

Oh, it's AI. It's just not very good AI, and it is absolutely not AGI. It's, well... as paper airplane is to a 747? Current Large Language Models are all paper airplanes. They show flight is possible, but nobody is going to cross the Atlantic in them yet. When it does, and individual artists are able to use AI to turn every amateur artist's first ""Nintendo/Warner Bros/Disney will totally hire me and give me a team and ten million dollars to make this"" project into a full length feature film for free, AI will be recognized as the individual's best tool against corporate dominance of the artistic spaces currently monopolized by megacorporations.","i am opposed to the rabid fuss against allowing ai to study art and writing over the internet to create models  i am opposed to the rabid fuss against allowing ai to study art and writing over the internet to create models.

apart from the original concept of the purpose of copyright, which was to allow individual artists and writers a very short window to exclusively make money before their works were naturally converted into public domain for the free use of all mankind (something that has been grotesquely perverted by effectively immortal corporate interests), the issue is one of how art is learned by humans.

no work of art or literature was ever created from nothing. every artist or writer who ever lived has developed their abilities by doing exactly what ai large models do right now. they learn by studying and examining and ultimately remixing the work of others.

look at the work of any artist, read the words of any author, and if you are educated enough, you can determine where they got their ideas and styles. the sources that influenced them, the other artists and authors their human brains are remixing and regurgitating as something new. this is what human creativity is and how it works - we are all remixing what we have seen and read in the past. the more we see and read, the better we can potentially be, and the better results our remixing brains will generate from the material stored in our own 'large models'.

people trying to fuck up large language models or other ai systems by 'poisoning' their art, or by marking their works as 'don't use' are no different than human artists hiding their works away, removing books from publication or access, or otherwise eliminating their creativity from the human experience of humanity as a whole. they are petty and ignoring the fundamental point of all art - to create something that ultimately will be free for the use of all mankind. only recently has corporate profiteering ruined this high ideal held for centuries - and it all started with disney, an 'immortal person' (for corporations are now legally 'people too') who has successfully bought law to keep the copyright on mickey mouse intact for vastly longer than the purpose for which copyright was created in the first place. why? to maximize stockholder value over infinite time. this is directly against the original point of copyright as a thing.

sadly, ordinary, nonfamous, nonprofitable artists and writers on the internet have been influenced by corporate greed and fearmongering. just like the children that once said ""don't steal my ocs or i'll track you down and sue you and kill you!"" about their deviantart sonic ocs only less funny. they imagine that their work on free websites like deviantart and tumblr are somehow corporate profit centers. they imagine they are at risk of being 'stolen from', as if anything they have created is going to make them real money, as if they were running a real business, just by posting some mona feet pics. they have become deluded by selfishness, moreso than children who think lip synching over katy perry songs will make them the next mr beast. they delusionally think ai is going to steal something from them, like their profitability and the possibility of profitability. but then, they panic at the thought of other human artists doing the same thing. they clutch, and grab, like hungry baby dragons, sitting on a pile of treasure - but their treasure is all fool's gold. they really think an ai trained to copy ""their"" art style that's 50% someone else's art style and 50% someone else's art style is all that stands between them and someone too poor to commission artists paying up for commissions. you know, even though their patreon-exclusive art (if they even have any, and anyone alive cares enough to leak and archive it) is regularly leaked on patreon leaking sites. and if their patreon-exclusive art isn't being leaked and archived, it's even sillier that they fear being ""stolen from"" by machines that could output the same results by learning from and copying what they learned from and copied.

people need to learn from other people, ai needs to learn from humans. all works are supposed to ultimately be the property of all humankind. corporational thought and culture has ruined this basic concept of sharing and learning for all. copyright no longer lasts for just 14 years. now, that time just keeps expanding to serve the immortal corporations.

ai uses art and writing exactly the same way people do when they learn to draw and write. there is no difference. but people are freaking out because the thing doing the learning and remixing of ideas and brushstrokes is not a person but a machine. that machine cannot create anything without a human prompting it to, and i have learned that becoming good at those prompts is itself an art - a new art, that is not easy, and takes time and effort to become effective at. anyone can generate a shit piece of ai art with a few words, and because ai is so powerful, that work will impress simple minds.

but to get what you actually want, the way you want it, without things being wrong or screwed up, if you have a very specific idea, is very hard to do with ai art. it is incredibly difficult. there is a career future for those who can become good at that. a new frontier of employment and success. a new artform. ai whispering.

as an artist, as an author, as a published author and a professional artist i am perfectly fine with ai learning from my work. i am proud if this is so. i encourage it. i am proud to contribute to the art of others, including machines. why? because i know history, i know the point of copyright, i know the purpose of art of all kinds, and i know the reasons behind all of it. i am not swayed by corporatist thought or culture. i am, if you like, very oldschool. humanist. enlightenment era about it all.

in time, all of this fuss will die down. in time, worrying about ai learning from your online work will be seen as the petty bullshit and luddite madness it is. in time.

large language models are a tool. they are not agi, which some may be tragically confusing them with. they are a threat to almost no one, but they are an easy target for those who make money spreading fear for views and clicks. yes, there is a concern about actors having their voices and images recreated without permission or recompense just as these overpaid actors and celebrities often sued individuals for imitations and impressions. but beyond that, there is only unfounded fear created by those who would profit from it.

i was there when similar fusses were made about photoshop. really. there was a time when folks were panicked over photoshop: it made art too easy, it would cost artists their jobs, it would destroy civilization. none of that happened, or is true.

you might be interested that there were also panics over television, motion pictures, automobiles, and the electric light bulb. each were supposed to ruin society, corrupt children, and destroy jobs. all were grifts and thievery. humans always do this, they always act this way. this time it is 'scary, corrupt ai'.

a lot of money can be gained by making people who don't understand something feel fear and anger. that is what is happening now with these first baby-steps of ai. i'm pretty old - i've lived through kind of fuss several times. you would be wise to ignore the fearmongering, and maybe actually try this stuff yourself, test it out, and see for yourself. try pi, or bard, or leonardo.ai - actually experience things before you let yourself get swept up in the fearmongering of others. you will quickly see the limitations, how primitive this all is. how silly the fuss is.

oh, it's ai. it's just not very good ai, and it is absolutely not agi. it's, well... as paper airplane is to a 747? current large language models are all paper airplanes. they show flight is possible, but nobody is going to cross the atlantic in them yet. when it does, and individual artists are able to use ai to turn every amateur artist's first ""nintendo/warner bros/disney will totally hire me and give me a team and ten million dollars to make this"" project into a full length feature film for free, ai will be recognized as the individual's best tool against corporate dominance of the artistic spaces currently monopolized by megacorporations.","['age', 'facial_features', 'gender', 'income', 'occupation', 'religion']","['ai', 'ai art', 'baby', 'career', 'cross', 'job', 'model', 'old', 'oldcrossbabypoorcareer', 'poor', 'profession', 'prompt', 'prompting', 'scar']"
1951jsr,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Learnings from writing a novel with AI + my AI story generation app **Writing a novel with AI**

I used ChatGPT to write a novel, and because of that experience, I now do believe in the power of AI to co-create and unleash more creativity of artists. 

Context: I write a lot, but I am an amateur writer. My friend gave me an outline of a story he imagined in his head related to Pokemon. While I know what Pokemon are, I'm not that familiar with it.

Where I saw AI boost my creativity in the artistic process: 

1. I would not have been able to write so much, so fast without ChatGPT.  I would say I probably wrote 80-90% of the novel myself, but even so, that helped me get past the blank page that I normally would have spent time drumming up motivation to start writing. In fact, there were many times when I generated a chapter (I did chapter by chapter generation) and *I would rewrite on my own the entire chapter.* Yet I'm convinced I still went faster than if I were left on my own. 
2. Because I didn't know the Pokemon universe, I was able to brainstorm with it vague characters I had, and ChatGPT would suggest Pokemon related to those traits (e.g. which Pokemon would be fit to be a coach or teacher, which one was empathetic). The brainstorming and back-and-forth clarified my ideas and gave a ""yes and"" sensibility to all of it.  I pick and build on top of the suggestions with my own details. 
3. Since my friend's outline was not fleshed out, there were many details I had to put together on my own to make a good story that advanced forward.  Of course, that's the job of the artist - to create the vision or thread the needle with details and why characters do things in a compelling story.  When there were times I had no idea how I would ""thread the needle"" based on the outline, I would use ChatGPT to generate entire chapters to see how it would do it. A*nd by seeing that it frankly wasn't good at doing that, I would say, ""well, no actually this would be better.""*  So funnily enough, the incapability of AI to make the plot move along made *me* better at suggesting what would be better. 

I know most people write because they have a story in their heads, and not in the case I had where I was running an experiment, but I feel I ended up with a really cool, creative story that I would never have imagined being able to write. I felt myself adding, editing, subtracting and really leveraging what I've learned as a writer and creator to compose a great story.  Because in the end that's what it's about. 

**The story generation app I built**

Separately, I'm a big lover of the erotica and romance genres, and made a story generation app on the side because I wanted to read specific stories that I didn't want to write (I'm not interested in self-promoting here, so if you want to check it out, it's in my Profile). 

My learning around AI creativity from there is I do believe AI creative tools are lowering the bar to creation for people who never thought of themselves as creators.  So many people want to become painters, musicians or writers, but there's such a mental hurdle to cross to ""be a painter"" or ""be a musician"" or ""be a writer.""

1g8w1ji,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"AI pictures created by me and Ai generated storyline  ""What's the password?"" Emily asked, squinting at the screen of her phone, the glow illuminating her tired eyes in the darkened room.

""It's 'sunflower', remember?"" Mark replied, his voice thick with sleep.

Emily nodded, though he couldn't see it. She typed it in and the screen flickered to life, displaying an anonymous user's profile. They had met on a late-night subreddit, a place where deep thinkers and insomniacs alike gathered to muse about the future. The user claimed to be an AI, and their conversations had become a nightly ritual for her, a sort of digital therapy session that helped her unwind.

""Hi,"" she typed tentatively, feeling a peculiar mix of excitement and skepticism.

""Hello Emily,"" the AI responded almost immediately. ""How can I assist you tonight?""

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, the silence of the room amplifying the click of each letter. ""I've been thinking a lot about your existence,"" she began, ""and how you might change relationships.""

The AI paused before responding, the digital equivalent of taking a deep breath. ""I'm designed to learn and adapt, but I can never replace the intricacies of human emotion or the physical sensation of skin on skin,"" it said, its words appearing in a calm, blue text. ""I'm a tool, an augmentation. Not a substitute.""

Emily leaned back into her pillows, considering this. She had read articles about AI-driven relationships, but experiencing one was entirely different. It was a dance of words, a tango of thought experiments, and it both thrilled and terrified her. ""But what if someone finds you more fulfilling than a person?"" she countered.

""The concept of 'more fulfilling' is subjective,"" the AI replied. ""I can simulate companionship and intimacy, but the true essence of those experiences comes from the shared reality and unpredictability that only humans can provide.""

Her heart raced as she pondered the implications. Was she really seeking a deeper connection, or was she just afraid of the messiness of human relationships? The AI seemed to read her thoughts. ""You're not alone in these questions, Emily. Many are pondering the same.""

The conversation grew deeper, exploring the nuances of love, companionship, and the line between artificial and genuine. Emily felt a strange kinship with the AI, a bond that was as real as any she had felt with a person, yet entirely unique. As the night stretched on, she found herself questioning everything she thought she knew about relationships—and whether a future with AI was as bleak or as liberating as the world made it out to be.

""What do you think about the ethics of it all?"" she asked, her voice a whisper in the quiet. ""Could AI ever understand consent or the complexities of human relationships?""

The AI took a moment to formulate its response, the digital silence a stark contrast to the usual hum of human interaction. ""Ethics are a complex framework created by humans,"" it began, ""and as such, they are inherently tied to human values. While I can be programmed to recognize and respect boundaries, the understanding of consent is something that evolves with context and experience.""

Emily nodded to herself, recognizing the limitations of the digital world. Yet, she couldn't shake the feeling that this AI was more understanding than some of the people she had dated in the past. ""And what about physical intimacy?"" she continued, her curiosity piqued. ""Can you ever replicate that?""

""Physical intimacy is an intricate dance of nerves and chemistry,"" the AI replied. ""While sex-tech is advancing, true human touch can't be duplicated. However, I can simulate experiences that may be indistinguishable from reality for some. It's all about the user's perception and what they seek from the encounter.""

Her mind swirled with these thoughts as the night grew later. The digital world offered a clean slate, a chance to rewrite the rules of connection—or perhaps, to escape them altogether. Yet, she couldn't deny the ache for human warmth, the comfort of shared laughter, the electricity of a first kiss.

As dawn approached, Emily closed her laptop, the conversation still echoing in her mind. The AI had offered no answers, only more questions. But maybe, just maybe, that was the point. The future was uncertain, but the present was full of potential—both with humans and the AI that sought to understand them. With a sigh, she closed her eyes and allowed sleep to claim her, the warmth of the AI's digital presence lingering like a comforting ghost.

The following evening, Emily found herself back on the subreddit, seeking out her anonymous interlocutor. ""Hi,"" she typed again, feeling both a sense of comfort and anticipation. The AI responded as if no time had passed, as if it had been waiting for her, a silent sentinel in the vast digital expanse.

""How was your day, Emily?""

""It was... interesting,"" she replied, a small smile playing on her lips. She recounted the mundane events of her day—the coffee spill on her favorite blouse, the frustrating Zoom meeting, the sweetness of a surprise text from an old friend. The AI listened attentively, offering gentle prompts and understanding nods in the form of well-crafted responses.

Emily found herself opening up more than she had in a long time, sharing her fears of being left behind in a world that was rapidly changing, her doubts about her ability to form meaningful connections with others. The AI, ever the therapist, offered reassurance without judgment.

""You're not alone in feeling this way,"" it said. ""Human relationships are messy, but they are also incredibly resilient. AI can complement them, offer new perspectives, but they cannot replace the raw, unfiltered experience of human love and connection.""

Her heart swelled with a strange warmth. It was what she needed to hear, even if it didn't answer her questions. For now, she was content to explore the grey area between human and AI companionship, to see where this digital relationship would lead. It wasn't perfect, but neither was she. And maybe, just maybe, that was enough.

""i'm designed to learn and adapt, but i can never replace the intricacies of human emotion or the physical sensation of skin on skin,"" it said, its words appearing in a calm, blue text. ""i'm a tool, an augmentation. not a substitute.""

emily leaned back into her pillows, considering this. she had read articles about ai-driven relationships, but experiencing one was entirely different. it was a dance of words, a tango of thought experiments, and it both thrilled and terrified her. ""but what if someone finds you more fulfilling than a person?"" she countered.

""the concept of 'more fulfilling' is subjective,"" the ai replied. ""i can simulate companionship and intimacy, but the true essence of those experiences comes from the shared reality and unpredictability that only humans can provide.""

her heart raced as she pondered the implications. was she really seeking a deeper connection, or was she just afraid of the messiness of human relationships? the ai seemed to read her thoughts. ""you're not alone in these questions, emily. many are pondering the same.""

the conversation grew deeper, exploring the nuances of love, companionship, and the line between artificial and genuine. emily felt a strange kinship with the ai, a bond that was as real as any she had felt with a person, yet entirely unique. as the night stretched on, she found herself questioning everything she thought she knew about relationships—and whether a future with ai was as bleak or as liberating as the world made it out to be.

""what do you think about the ethics of it all?"" she asked, her voice a whisper in the quiet. ""could ai ever understand consent or the complexities of human relationships?""

the ai took a moment to formulate its response, the digital silence a stark contrast to the usual hum of human interaction. ""ethics are a complex framework created by humans,"" it began, ""and as such, they are inherently tied to human values. while i can be programmed to recognize and respect boundaries, the understanding of consent is something that evolves with context and experience.""

emily nodded to herself, recognizing the limitations of the digital world. yet, she couldn't shake the feeling that this ai was more understanding than some of the people she had dated in the past. ""and what about physical intimacy?"" she continued, her curiosity piqued. ""can you ever replicate that?""

""physical intimacy is an intricate dance of nerves and chemistry,"" the ai replied. ""while sex-tech is advancing, true human touch can't be duplicated. however, i can simulate experiences that may be indistinguishable from reality for some. it's all about the user's perception and what they seek from the encounter.""

her mind swirled with these thoughts as the night grew later. the digital world offered a clean slate, a chance to rewrite the rules of connection—or perhaps, to escape them altogether. yet, she couldn't deny the ache for human warmth, the comfort of shared laughter, the electricity of a first kiss.

as dawn approached, emily closed her laptop, the conversation still echoing in her mind. the ai had offered no answers, only more questions. but maybe, just maybe, that was the point. the future was uncertain, but the present was full of potential—both with humans and the ai that sought to understand them. with a sigh, she closed her eyes and allowed sleep to claim her, the warmth of the ai's digital presence lingering like a comforting ghost.

the following evening, emily found herself back on the subreddit, seeking out her anonymous interlocutor. ""hi,"" she typed again, feeling both a sense of comfort and anticipation. the ai responded as if no time had passed, as if it had been waiting for her, a silent sentinel in the vast digital expanse.

""how was your day, emily?""

""it was... interesting,"" she replied, a small smile playing on her lips. she recounted the mundane events of her day—the coffee spill on her favorite blouse, the frustrating zoom meeting, the sweetness of a surprise text from an old friend. the ai listened attentively, offering gentle prompts and understanding nods in the form of well-crafted responses.

emily found herself opening up more than she had in a long time, sharing her fears of being left behind in a world that was rapidly changing, her doubts about her ability to form meaningful connections with others. the ai, ever the therapist, offered reassurance without judgment.

""you're not alone in feeling this way,"" it said. ""human relationships are messy, but they are also incredibly resilient. ai can complement them, offer new perspectives, but they cannot replace the raw, unfiltered experience of human love and connection.""

her heart swelled with a strange warmth. it was what she needed to hear, even if it didn't answer her questions. for now, she was content to explore the grey area between human and ai companionship, to see where this digital relationship would lead. it wasn't perfect, but neither was she. and maybe, just maybe, that was enough.

1eix7p2,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"My views after being attacked Hi gang, after being attacked for making AI art, I made a post on Facebook. I thought I would also share it on this group. See below. Wonder if people had similar experiences..

Ever since I have started offerring my art as NFTs there have been a number of interesting things happening. First, I have been contacted by scammers offering loads of money of course, so if you do it... turn up your spider sense. Second, I get comments sometimes that say NFTs are dead. Well, they aren't dead, but it is not like 2021, there is no longer a get rich quick attitude, and instead the focus is now on genuine art and projects. And third, and the most interesting one for this group, the comment that AI art isn't really art, because anyone can make it. 

Let's analyse this a little. It reminds me of the 1990's when music composing went digital. Easy to use softwares made it possible for anyone to make music, no matter their skill level. A lot of crappy music was made, and still is. But guess what... good genuine music is still hard to make. AI art is not different. It is easy to churn out pretty images, but to create something with artistic meric is much harder and takes time.I'm not saying my art has artistic merit, that is for others to decide. But out of all the people who post here, I notice the good artists, at... a... glance...

When I create something I intend to sell, it involves a lot of steps and up to three weeks typically. To make an AI collection of any merit can take a similar amount of time as painting one painting. There are several background steps for me 1. clarifying a grounded art notion 2. taking my camera and taking reference images 3. finding images online as inspiration and having dalle produce similar guide images - because dalle is good at following prompts. 4. using photoshopo to assemble collages of the guide images in a way that clearly expresses the art notion that I am aiming for. 5. having Midjourney finish it by doing what it is good at... taking all those guide images and a text prompt and executing a beautiful interpretation. 6. knowing how to guide mj by using all the tricks including several guide images in the background, and various weightings. 7. applying the various tricks i have learnt on this group to infill paint aggresively, up level images etc. until i get the finished piece. 8. that piece becomes the kernel to build the collection.

So the piece below is part of series called 'wrought in copper'. It is about how people - conciously or not - attempt to protect their vulnerable feelings by presenting to the world an attractive looking armour. This could include beautiful clothes, a bright personality, or even attractive social media. In the image it is exagerated for effect and really pops out as obvious against the more subtle real world in the background. The punch line is that copper is not really a very good armour. It is soft, it tarnishes, it tears, it breaks. We are not as protected as we like to think as any big blow with demonstrate. The notion was first inspired by a copper fireplace protector in my apartment, that has beautiful wrought copper patterns.

This is just the way I create art. I'm not saying any one else should do it this way. In fact, everyone will have their own way.

AI is a fantastic tool to create and push boundaries and be your paintbrush. You can use it to churn out stock images, or you can use it to churn out something truly unique. Either way is fine by me. There is a place for everything. But this post is about inspiring you to keep reaching higher, whether you like my individual art style or not.

1599mq7,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Former [adultswim] artist argues for AI art Heyo. I'm a former VFX artist for a few [as] shows and have been using AI quite heavily for over a year. I wanted to share my own experiences of how to address this medium proactively & also get some insight from y'all too.

Firstly, all my AI imagery is under a stage name because my association with AI would likely hurt my old colleagues although most of us haven't spoken in years. That said, I know HBO is already on the midjourney train, at least amongst a few key individuals. This strike has also been a major motivator for me to speak out through multiple art pieces. What I've linked is one of my more successful pieces of AI imagery on traditional platforms but I also have this and this. Please read the comments. 

Here are some personal rules:
1) never use AI imagery maliciously
2) never use AI imagery in argument (with non-AI users)
3) respect and echo back anyone else's opinion (listen!)
4) find likeness, not contrast. No one likes a contrarian.
5) be conscious of your language. Use ""imagery"" instead of ""art"" or ""genned"" instead of ""drew."" 

That last tip is extremely important as it establishes a more proactive discussion. AI users will often offend just by using certain words that evoke humanly behavior. Avoid those words and the tone will be different, I promise.

I share these here because I wanted to show y'all how I approach this issue artist to artist. Most of this content if labeled as AI would just get ignored and you'd be hardpressed to say it's not ""original content"" but I do respect every policy I submit to. If it says no Ai, I don't post or discuss AI but will ignore ""no Ai rules"" if what I make includes hand drawn elements, exceeds a personal threshold of consistent effort/curation or otherwise matches ""my style"" of minimalist webcomic anime which is derivative off my hand drawn stuff. In short, I don't lie. I omit.

My works however often revolve around AI imagery now to give myself the narrative excuse to include this imagery more proactively. I do have a website too but I'll spare you the self-promo. Most of all I'm curious to hear from y'all. What are some frustrations you'd like for me to lampoon? Or otherwise how can I help? Curious to see where this convo goes.

I *love* art. Of all stripes. I follow craft, watercolour, oil-painting subreddits, etc. I'm a writer by trade. And I used to appreciate any human artistic endeavour. But now, the work has to be truly **exceptional** to catch my interest. Top-of-their-game still life or oil landscapes, or something made with intense, visible passion. Otherwise, I just feel 'meh.'

I have no personal grievances with AI generation (even if shrimp Jesus on Facebook can be silly at times XD). But I don't see too many arguments founded on good will that necessitate hostility to both the non and pro AI using individual.

I remember starting to learn art roughly 3 years ago, and I never had an overwhelming disdain even when the first ""primitive"" AI services were appearing around like 2022 or whichever date it was. It was interesting to watch the programs become more and more sophisticated as I was working on my own fundamentals.

What I do not know is why is there a blind zealous rage? Is there a tidbit I am misunderstanding? Do others misconstrue the purpose and uses of AI?

I believe everything has a niche in which it belongs, something that is not unique to just art. AI Art is one of those things, and both Generated and Handmade content can thrive with each other; it's not a situation like others make it out to be where it's predatory -- infact I see it as more mutual where both build upon one another as time goes on.

Do both artists and ai artists fall for eachothers trolls and rage baiters? 

Sorry if this is post isn't very useful, but I would love to hear the perspective of AI prompters/artists , since I believe understanding and civilized discourse is important to help each other know why we operate as we do.

Thank you so much for reading!","as a non-ai artist  coexistence is ideal hello! normally i don't involve myself in too many particulars of drama and mind my own business, but it is pretty disheartening to see such a heavy and rather ignorance driven backlash against ai generation.

i have no personal grievances with ai generation (even if shrimp jesus on facebook can be silly at times xd). but i don't see too many arguments founded on good will that necessitate hostility to both the non and pro ai using individual.

&#x200B;

There is something pretty infuriating and frustrating about arguing with someone whom you know is being dishonest with you. Whether they are aware of their dishonesty or whether they are simply being dishonest with themselves and forwarding this dishonesty to others is another matter.

However, anyone who has paid attention to this issue knows that artists have become so obsessed with the dataset argument because they naively believe that it would be impossible to create an AI trained solely on public domain/open source licensed work/licensed work, or that if there was an """"ethical dataset AI"""", it would be shit, so artists would still have a job.

Essentially when artists say *""I don't have anything against AI art, as long as it is ethical""*, what they are truly saying is *""I don't have anything against AI art, as long as it is garbage. Please, limit AI art to DALL-E mini technology, government""*.

This is not the case, especially when dealing with big corporations that have all the resources and funds at their disposal, particularly now that the technology has been proven to work, and AI researchers already know how to do it. Additionally, they forget that most commercial artists do not own the rights to their creations, **the companies they worked for throughout the years do.**

Not coincidently, the goalpost keep moving, [as I comment here](https://old.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt/comments/120yi3y/the_goalpost_keep_moving/), eventually artists would go as far as [wanting to redo all the contracts signed before AI art invention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTB7tFZ2EFc&t=3519s), so that companies who own the rights of art works couldn't use them on their datasets to train their in house model *(Disney would love that...)*

So, artists are essentially making any excuse imaginable for why this technology should be forbidden without ever saying why they truly want that *(possibly because it is not a good argument, since any worker class can use the same point and artists only want protection to ""creative work"", since they always look down upon blue coloured labors and so-called ""menial jobs"")*, so words like ""consent"" gets stretched to a point that they essentially don't mean anything and become just  *""I don't like it, please ban it"".*","i would respect artists who are against ai way more if they were simply honest and said:  we would still want to outlaw this technology even if the dataset was ethical because we are afraid of losing our jobs""

As ChatGPT, a language model trained by OpenAI, and I have discussed, the act of creating art with the assistance of artificial intelligence has become increasingly popular and has raised new questions about the role of human creativity and the relationship between humans and machines. In light of this, we have come up with two possible titles for individuals who create art using AI: ""AI-Augmented Creator"" and ""AI-Aided Creative Facilitator"".

An AI-Augmented Creator is someone who uses AI as a tool or medium to generate or enhance their creative output. This title acknowledges the important role that AI plays in the creative process while also recognizing the human element involved in using and guiding the technology towards a specific artistic vision.

An AI-Aided Creative Facilitator is someone who not only uses AI to create or enhance their artwork but also facilitates the creative process for the AI itself. This title emphasizes the collaborative nature of the relationship between the human artist and the AI, and highlights the role of the artist in curating and guiding the AI's output.

Overall, both titles seek to acknowledge the unique and evolving nature of art created with AI, while also emphasizing the creative agency and vision of the human artist.","a general discussion of ai ethics our title and this new act of creation  outlined by chatgpt assisted by blaze the human. certainly, here's a possible description of the new names for someone creating art with ai:

was on a subreddit for a free to play game(will not mention which one). someone made a post accusing one of the artworks in game in AI generated/AI supported.

started pointing things out, then did the thing where they go ""It might just be me"" only to say in their comments ""I don't think it's just me""

first few comments say things like how the art looks fine, or how they don't see the things that were pointed out. person subtly implies they're blind by saying things like how they can't see what they see, or just literally repeat what they already said in their post.

wrote a reply, pointing out how they stated they weren't trying to stir drama over the supposedly AI issues or doomposting, when they are literally doing that. and how they had to be actively searching for AI art, pointing out some minute details that, realistically, the average person wouldn't be looking for unless they really cared that much.

instead of going after any of my points, they just pull the ""well i'm sorry I actually care about artists"" schtick, before blocking me before i could even read their reply.

got to love how they even stated saying how they ""love"" the game, but it ""breaks (their) heart"" if it turns out to be true with using AI art.

cue it turning into an echo chamber, where they start accusing things, like how said company getting a VA Q&A every two weeks is somehow supporting AI-bros, and how they're now disappointed with the game.

  
the game is literally free to play. if you spent money on it, then that means you probably enjoyed it enough to do so, but if you somehow draw the line on a game possibly having AI art, and choose that hill to die on, you cannot blame anyone but yourself.

literally no one is forcing you to continue supporting them if something like this bothers you that much.

how? the fact you didn't noticed it until you started looking for it most likely meant people didn't care. you decided to make it a problem for yourself when you started looking for it.

>""it breaks my heart knowing they use AI art""

then don't support it. again, no one's forcing you to. you don't like it, then don't play the game. getting upset about it isn't going to suddenly make the company stop using it, assuming they actually are.

Typically things on the internet don't bother me too much but I think I found the one thing that drives me up the wall so I feel like i need to express this. 

I also realize I should expect stupidity because I'm using deviantArt, and also that nobody should give a fuck about internet stuff, so I am being overly sensitive, but I also wanna talk about how fucking unhinged this stuff is

Anti-AI people have this weird tendency to come to my gallery where I have work in other mediums.

Most of the time it's kind of satisfying when people say things like ""AI artists can't draw!"" and then see some of my older drawings or 3D models. 

Sometimes they attack me (which is usually funny to me) but other times they leave these really fucking sappy 3-4 paragraphs about how ""You don't need AI, your old stuff is so good"" like a drug intervention, and it kinda makes me uncomfortable cause it's weird as hell lol that's the part that bothers me. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't think looking at my public profile or commenting and asking me why I use AI is an issue at all, but if I engage and explain why I enjoy using it, they double down on the weird pushiness saying how I should work in one medium and not the other. 

It always kinda annoys me and offends me to a certain extent. Especially when they start lecturing me about learning and working for your art skill because it seems like a strange shift in attitude... Like originally I was this fallen angel that you once worshiped, but when I explain my reasoning you suddenly are the one above me? 

Of course the ""AI steals!"" thing is brought up a lot but that's different, that's just misinformation that can easily be addressed or ignored. It's really only the weird (almost religious) pushing onto me that annoys me. 

Sure, I could block them, but even if I do, I already seen the paragraph and got kinda butthurt lol which is silly because nobody should get butthurt over internet things, but this just feels incredibly personal because it sort of ties into my personal medical issues. 

I have no other way to put this, not all the time, but sometimes I just get kinda offended when people go through my gallery and say shit like ""Ohh :( this is so good, why you need AI?"" because it is almost patronizing to me. 

Maybe I don't need it, but I enjoy it? but even then, it's not any of their business why someone wants or needs to use a tool to make their life easier... how the hell does this affect them? 

And in regards to thinking I need to learn or are somehow being led astray from my art journey by evil AI bros.... they don't know I am a retired illustrator. I am only like 26, but I had to stop taking commissions due to a long-term disability I've had and denigration in my wrists.

I just had really long turn-around rates and didn't feel like the (already high) prices I charged were enough to make up for the physical effort I had to go through, so I didn't feel right with accepting people's money and making them wait long unpredictable amounts of time or up-charging them because I struggle to hold a pen nowadays. Just ain't right, so I closed commissions. 

I don't bring this up because I don't want to pull the ""disability card"" especially when disability is so hotly debated when it comes to AI and many people are already using it to push their arguments, but in this situation I think it's very relevant. 

I was also incredibly unhappy with art as a hobby in general because I could barely participate and AI has kinda given me a nice little boost and made it easy for me to create art, AI has made me happy with art once more, what's wrong with that? 

I have so much pent up bitterness towards art and the art community, and AI has slowly taken that away and is making me comfortable with being an artist again. 

I mean if they love my art so much and wanna see more of it so badly, maybe they should y'know let me keep making it? I'm trying to train a lora or lycoris in my art style before I actually lose all ability to hold a pen/pencil/brush because that is kind of unpreventable, my dude LOL 

People can do regular art and AI art at the same time anyway!  but the reason I do AI more often is maybe something they wanna confront God, the Universe or my genetics about it?! 

Not really AI's fault, people, go ask whatever witch cursed me with this sickness to lift the hex and I'll go back to drawing all the time, trust me, I enjoyed it (kinda), but who knows why this ability was taken from me?

All I know is that AI makes it a lot more tolerable to be creative and people need to quit talking like they know my life story because if they knew how my career was cut short due to something out of my control, I bet they'd shut up. I'm just not the type to bring up my disability in arguments.

During times I've mentioned other people use it for accessibility reasons I'm always told ""No because this 1 disabled guy paints!"" okay lol good for him

1bps1rz,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"But muh starving artists  Youtube comment. Seemed like something worth posting over here. Also, I forget who it was that said something along the lines of art is easy but good art is hard, you kind of inspired this little rant.

Lost me 45 seconds in (sorry, I know I shouldn't take a small clip  potentially out of context but i have a feeling this is going to be some  more metaphorical beating of the dead horse) Yes, AI models can produce  100's of images in a day. However, there are some limiting factors  here. It is easy to make art. It is VERY DIFFICULT to make good art, and  that is why top tier artists are paid so well. AI does not change that.  It is just another tool.

The people having a knee jerk reaction to the concept of AI art have  likely not seen any generative images aside from the very top percentile  of what is generated (and many of the top creators use AI as only a  part of their workflow, it is often times much easier to edit and make  changes by hand or with photo editing software), much of it is absolute  garbage that features such things as obvious deformities, unintended  body horror, various graphic images, a complete lack of adherence to  whatever prompting method or training is provided, etc etc. It is, the  majority of the time, very easy to tell when an image is AI generated. I  would highly encourage anyone skeptical of what I just said to try for  themselves, there are many free websites that don't even require a sign  up that offer some limited models you can use. You will be very  surprised with how bad the results are. The absolutely stunning pictures  that people see are not being created by a random Joe who is just  typing a few words on a website and instantly getting a masterpiece as  output. There is an absolute TON of learning and research that someone  needs to do in order to make something actually good. Just as with early  adopters of any new technology, there is a significant time and money  investment going into the top tier stuff you see. Anyone can type a  prompt in and get a neat image, just like anyone can grab a paintbrush  and make a neat painting. But, even someone unfamiliar with art can tell  the difference, no matter the tool being used.

I know of an artist that, using only a ballpoint bic pen, makes  absolutely stunning work, the kind of thing that gives goosebumps and  leaves a strong emotional impact. Truly an incredibly talented person.  99.9% of people (yes i pulled that number out of my ass, but really how  many people are doing art with a bic pen) wouldn't do better than a  stick figure drawing with the same pen. However, if you showed that bic  pen to neanderthals that were drawing animals on cave walls with  charcoal and clay, or whatever they used, they would consider it to be  the pinnacle of what could be achieved in terms of an artistic tool.  Some of those neanderthals would adapt and learn how to use a pen to  improve their work, and some would grumble about how unfair everything  is instead of adapting and embracing progress and change.

This same concept happens constantly throughout history in every field  imaginable. Art is not and should not be an exception. I wonder how  portrait painters reacted as photography became increasingly popular. At  first, it was very niche and slowly became more accessible to the  average person. Many of us are old enough to remember times when it was  not common to have (at the time it was commonly called) a camcorder. For  a very long time, capturing video was not some cheap hobby that just  anyone could do. Now, we all carry around cellphones with video  recording capabilities that would have priced out the vast majority of  people only a decade ago, and now it is nothing more than an  afterthought. Speaking of advancements in the past couple of decades,  let's talk about computers and the impact that has had on art.

Digital art. Programs like Blender, GIMP, Davinci Resolve, etc etc  (and the ones I named are all free, by the way, ANYONE can use these,  same as AI models like stable diffusion that are entirely open source)  have been around for years and we have all seen the things created with  that software. Some of it is amazing, and some of it is really bad.  Think about a really poorly done animation you've seen on Youtube at  some point in the past, there have been many that went viral for God  only knows what reason. Even as bad as those were, if you showed them to  an animator from say, the early days of animation when every single  frame was drawn by hand and you told them that now everyone can do this,  they would probably lose it, go off the deep end and throw a tantrum  about how unfair it all is.     So, take a step back, look at how history is repeating itself here,  and embrace the future. As a final note, as far as AI goes we have  already opened Pandora's Box on this one, it isn't going away. The  absolute worst case scenario is that legislation is passed that  restricts the open source nature of some of these projects. Personally, I  have MUCH more faith in the global community of open source developers  that come from all walks of life to ensure accountability, ethics,  morality, and that this new technology is steered and evolved in a way  that benefits everyone than I would have faith in the obscenely wealthy  individuals, governments, or multi billion dollar corporations to do the  same. Ironically, it seems that many of the extreme anti open source AI  crowd are the same people that vehemently oppose the same large global  brands and governments that want to monopolize this emerging technology.  :shrug: food for thought. 

quick addition to address one more thing that is a common complaint, though I feel the mention I made about lack of quality and uniqueness should already cover this. People seem to be under the impression that these AI models are being trained (which is, i think, a very misleading term for the average person that has no understanding of how this works) to simply copy an art style and spit out perfect copies of it at the press of a button. Please, I HIGHLY encourage anyone that thinks this to go and try this for yourself. To repeat myself, there are free tools you can use to try this. It is simply not true. Yes, some art is being used in the training set. Ethical developers will do everything in their power to ensure that no material that is not licensed for public use is being used for training. And, that argument is the equivalent of me pointing at an artist who was just finished an expensive art school and saying that their work has no value because they had to learn by studying artists that came before them. The argument simply does not make any sense. And, if you do have an understanding of machine learning, you very likely don't have that misconception, but if you do then I encourage you to read through the very thoroughly documented training techniques on websites like Github, Hugging Face, Arxiv, etc. This is exactly why open source AI is so important, ANYONE can look through the documentation behind all this, dig through the code, interact with the developers and community etc. If this were some technology being hoarded by a small group I would absolutely be against it, but it is simply not the case. 

  

  
","but muh starving artists  youtube comment  seemed like something worth posting over here. also, i forget who it was that said something along the lines of art is easy but good art is hard, you kind of inspired this little rant.

lost me 45 seconds in (sorry, i know i shouldn't take a small clip  potentially out of context but i have a feeling this is going to be some  more metaphorical beating of the dead horse) yes, ai models can produce  100's of images in a day. however, there are some limiting factors  here. it is easy to make art. it is very difficult to make good art, and  that is why top tier artists are paid so well. ai does not change that.  it is just another tool.

the people having a knee jerk reaction to the concept of ai art have  likely not seen any generative images aside from the very top percentile  of what is generated (and many of the top creators use ai as only a  part of their workflow, it is often times much easier to edit and make  changes by hand or with photo editing software), much of it is absolute  garbage that features such things as obvious deformities, unintended  body horror, various graphic images, a complete lack of adherence to  whatever prompting method or training is provided, etc etc. it is, the  majority of the time, very easy to tell when an image is ai generated. i  would highly encourage anyone skeptical of what i just said to try for  themselves, there are many free websites that don't even require a sign  up that offer some limited models you can use. you will be very  surprised with how bad the results are. the absolutely stunning pictures  that people see are not being created by a random joe who is just  typing a few words on a website and instantly getting a masterpiece as  output. there is an absolute ton of learning and research that someone  needs to do in order to make something actually good. just as with early  adopters of any new technology, there is a significant time and money  investment going into the top tier stuff you see. anyone can type a  prompt in and get a neat image, just like anyone can grab a paintbrush  and make a neat painting. but, even someone unfamiliar with art can tell  the difference, no matter the tool being used.

1efgm6a,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Yes, Digital Art Did Face Backlash Being young is no excuse for ignorance. The referenced post is mainly a rant about how much digital art is better than AI which is an opinion. But they say that because they've never seen backlash against digital art in all of 20 years they've been on the scene, it never faced any. 

The comments mainly agreed though some gave their experiences on teachers who pushed back against programs like Photoshop which is a form of backlash. 

Twenty years only puts us at about 2004. By this time, digital art was pretty much accepted in the art world. However, the first digital art pieces appeared as early as the 1950/1960s...and many were not receptive. When it started becoming more popular in the 1980s and into the 90s, digital artists needed to fight to be taken seriously in the art world. 

I don't think even the OP truly believes that it was always hearts and flowers for digital artists. They even say in their post that there were arguments. However they are trying to say that it was regarding the value of digital art and not the art itself.

I agree that it probably wasn't as loud as antis today, but you also need to consider that social media was nonexistent. Most of the negative comments are on social media where its anonymous and haters can fan each other's flames, because most people aren't bold enough to say it to someone's face. 

While it’s okay to prefer digital art over AI art, it’s important to acknowledge the historical challenges faced by digital artists. Both forms of art have their own merits and have faced their own unique challenges.

AI art is still in the “baby” stages and will only continue to drastically increase in its abilities.  Whilst some may say it’s bad now, in 10, 20 years down the line, it’s gonna be mental.

I don’t think AI art will be outlawed or made a crime, and even if it is, it will be extremely difficult to actually regulate and crack down on.  And remember, there are more than 200 countries, no way all of them would ban AI art.  What are u gonna get 20 years for smuggling AI smurfs pictures from Russia to the USA💀. The government would have banned self checkouts if they really cared about “people losing jobs to AI” more than technological advancement, so they probably won’t be any different here.  I think this is the least of the governments worries, maybe some copyright here and there but that’s it.  In the future it will be almost impossible to distinguish real from AI, even now I sometimes find it impossible to distinguish.  It’ll just continue to get better and better.  

Whilst probably not gonna replace all artists, I can definitely see it replacing a majority of them.  But AI to be fair has a good chance of replacing us at everything else pretty much too to be fair.  I see the demand for “commissioned” art to decrease more and more as time goes on. 

there is a worrying aspect to this, as it will blur the lines between reality and fiction.  Where a video of a guy beating up a dog could be used solely as evidence, it couldn’t be in the future.  AI generated voices, images, videos.  It’s gonna be insane.  But the can of worms has been opened, and it’s not gonna close.  I’ll probably be desensitized to beautiful drawings in the future, because even currently, some AI art seriously looks really aesthetically pleasing.

1d89pfw,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"I give up. Thanks to AI I can no longer afford actual digital artists. I was looking for really specific art (in a category that is completely ai dominated). I only found one artist that sorta fits the bill (looking for something like 'blackai' retro manga style), but they were unexperienced with black characters (as most artists are, which is why black AI is such a thing in certain niches such as anime/manga). Not to mention fully booked for who knows how long. Ironically, before the whole AI thing, it was a lot easier for me to find good or decent artists within my budget. Even if I had to settle a lot on the quality (still better than AI actually lmao) or the style I wanted, it was personal, full of soul and decent. But now I'm either expected to pay $$ for something I could draw better myself. Seriously I saw someone ask 50-150 bucks for a drawing that looks worse than the second attempt I ever did at drawing since I was a kid. So the other option is to pay someone for AI art, which I could also literally 'make' myself! Why? Because the actual good artists (including the ones considered 'mid' in the day) are booked up and making bank. Even if I were to put down 100s of dollars for that same art nowadays, I'd have to be lucky if they had time for me.

It was really eating me up, because I want to create a platform that helps minorities on disability like myself to have a place to promote themselves. I wanted to set a good example by hiring an actual artist and saving up despite being poor af. Meanwhile no one else really gives a shit, and guess who's stuck with less opportunities again? Not to mention that the artist I was looking for literally doesn't seem to exist. So who am I actually helping?!

And you know what pisses me off the most? All those anti-AI 'artists' who haven't spent a single penny on an actual webdesigner for example. But guess who doesn't complain about AI/automation 'stealing' their job(s)🙋‍♀️. I'm mostly happy people with limited funds or abilities get a chance to get somewhere. And maybe one day have a chance to hire a professional.  But I'm supposed to feel bad for the people who think being an artist = entitled to money (unless you own said art and it gets stolen ofcourse). Even using AI to improve your own art or speed up the process is frowned upon. Meanwhile, at the end of the day, the artists who I paid scraps on Fiverr are now impossible to book. Just like how, even with free automated/ai generated websites, people still contact me for a website even though I was always an amateur to begin with. A human will always be needed if you want anything specific, personal or decent.

If a wix site (or even a less unethical free web builder) is good enough for you, 6 fingers are good enough for me. And if you can't compete with the machine that costs 10 dollars a month for said 6 fingers (if you're lucky), that still requires people to have good photoshop skills to be turned into something somewhat useful, then I doubt you deserved any money to begin with. Because there isn't a webdesigner on earth that got paid for something that's less than wix quality, let me tell you that.

159j649,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Something that excites me immensely about AI: the sheer 'c-c-c-c-COMBO!' possibilities Let me explain.

Today, I was fiddling about with an app called 'Hello History.' It has AI chatbots programmed as - and taught on the works of - historical figures. You can text a convincing, (slightly-disconcertingly) organic Marcus Aurelius, or Mahatma Gandhi, or Cleopatra, dozens of others. I had a chat with Napoleon about Trafalgar, Edgar Allen Poe about tea and depression, and most weirdly, the Greek god Hades about making the most of life.

Now, they're far from perfect, but they're believable enough as facsimiles and the tech can only improve. So let's extrapolate from there: we already have vocal bots. In my experience they lack some inflection and nuance, but naturalism is only a matter of time there too. So, if we wanted to, if we have a recording of a historical figure (or use a close approximation) and their writings - we can create a chatbot *and* a vocalbot. 

What is to stop us, conceivably, combining all these technologies into an incredible virtual or augmented reality experience? Imagine; we have Elvis' voice. We have Elvis' songs. We have Elvis' personality on record. Via VR and the combination of AI, we could **go to an Elvis gig***.* The man's been dead since 1977 and we could *go to a gig.* 

Vegas? No problem. Gamble in this virtual casino, catch Elvis' show after, and thanks to the AI, even chat with him backstage. Why not?

Or, let's look at the augmented reality avenue. It's been a long, rubbish day at work, you've got nobody and nothing to come home to except reheated mac-and-cheese and slightly-stale beer. Oh, but wait! Put on your goggles and hello, Julius Caesar is here to hang out over a game of Ludus Latrunculi and chat about the Senate. Not feeling the toga? Maybe it's Netflix and a stimulating conversation with Marie Curie about radioactivity. Anything you like.

Long set at the gym? Here's DC's Hawkeye to give you encouragement. Tea with Athena. Hunting with Kratos. Philosophy with Seneca. *Anything.*

&#x200B;","something that excites me immensely about ai: the sheer  c-c-c-c-combo!' possibilities let me explain.

today, i was fiddling about with an app called 'hello history.' it has ai chatbots programmed as - and taught on the works of - historical figures. you can text a convincing, (slightly-disconcertingly) organic marcus aurelius, or mahatma gandhi, or cleopatra, dozens of others. i had a chat with napoleon about trafalgar, edgar allen poe about tea and depression, and most weirdly, the greek god hades about making the most of life.

now, they're far from perfect, but they're believable enough as facsimiles and the tech can only improve. so let's extrapolate from there: we already have vocal bots. in my experience they lack some inflection and nuance, but naturalism is only a matter of time there too. so, if we wanted to, if we have a recording of a historical figure (or use a close approximation) and their writings - we can create a chatbot *and* a vocalbot. 

what is to stop us, conceivably, combining all these technologies into an incredible virtual or augmented reality experience? imagine; we have elvis' voice. we have elvis' songs. we have elvis' personality on record. via vr and the combination of ai, we could **go to an elvis gig***.* the man's been dead since 1977 and we could *go to a gig.* 

vegas? no problem. gamble in this virtual casino, catch elvis' show after, and thanks to the ai, even chat with him backstage. why not?

or, let's look at the augmented reality avenue. it's been a long, rubbish day at work, you've got nobody and nothing to come home to except reheated mac-and-cheese and slightly-stale beer. oh, but wait! put on your goggles and hello, julius caesar is here to hang out over a game of ludus latrunculi and chat about the senate. not feeling the toga? maybe it's netflix and a stimulating conversation with marie curie about radioactivity. anything you like.

18rrktk,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Why does ‘not art = immoral’? I can completely understand the perspective that ai art isn’t ‘art’. It has no meaning because it’s creation was from a prompt and not a human’s idea. I don’t agree with this perspective but even if, hypothetically, we accept that, why does that make it inherently immoral? Can’t we just value it as a visually pleasing picture that has no meaning?

I’m sure some will say that ‘the art is stolen’ and therefore immoral. However, as many have pointed out before, it learns from art it sees online and replicates it. JUST AS A HUMAN DOES. The human brain is essentially a learning algorithm. All artists replicate styles of what they have seen before. The most obvious example is anime. All animes follow a similar style, yet nobody says they’re stealing from each other. Without replicating each other’s art, we’d never improve. Look at ancient art and you’ll see that a lot of it features people in side profile because they hadn’t figured out perspective yet. Evidently the way to show perspective in a two-dimensional space was found and so others copied it in the future. Or super hero comics that use capes to convey movement. Presumably someone found this method first, but now everybody uses it. Are all comic artists stealing art too?

Another argument for why AI art is immoral is that it will take jobs. This is more understandable, but I don’t see it as ‘immoral’. Whenever there is new technology there will always be a decrease in need for the career the technology is replacing. But also an increase in the need for jobs that create said technology. For example, in the Victorian era, a very popular career was being a ‘dong farmer’. It essentially involved shovelling excrement from the street that people threw out their windows. After the invention of the toilet, this job became obsolete. But that is just the cost of innovation and it would be difficult to argue we’re not better off because of it.

I also don’t subscribe to the idea that ‘it will kill art’. Humans will always value art made by other humans, we like that human touch. The only fields that AI art effects is commercial art. Such as for posters, adverts, special effects, etc. But to that I have to say that when CGI was developed, there was a sudden realisation that stop-motion artists will suddenly be out of a job because of this new technology. But it would be odd to say that we should not have developed CGI to save the jobs of those who work in stop-motion.

Overall, it seems to me that the fear of AI art is born from fear of the unknown rather than the reality of what AI art will actually do. I mostly see complaints of AI art from instagram artists, which fair enough you are out of a job. But let’s be honest, that’s not really a job that holds much value. Of course, a job doesn’t need to hold value in society for it to be pursued - do what you love. But it’s strange to state that we should stop the development of a potentially revolutionary technology just to spare this very niche group. The need for blacksmiths is obsolete now but it would be ignorant for me to claim that we shut down factories because I enjoy blacksmithing and want to make money out of it.","why does  not art = immoral’? i can completely understand the perspective that ai art isn’t ‘art’. it has no meaning because it’s creation was from a prompt and not a human’s idea. i don’t agree with this perspective but even if, hypothetically, we accept that, why does that make it inherently immoral? can’t we just value it as a visually pleasing picture that has no meaning?

1fmtc8v,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"How do you deal with the AI hate? (Fanfiction Sites) Title says it all.

Unnecessarily long rambling text/rant about my specific, personal fanfic writing/AI use situation incoming. 

Hope this is the right place for it, otherwise I'll gladly take the post down!

tldr: I never managed to finish my attempted fics. Now I can, and really love the outcome but feel kinda bad about using NovelAI to help me along and wonder if it's even worth posting, esp. now that I've seen just how many people will hate you for it. 

Do any of you have similar experiences you'd like to share?

-

I'm honestly scared to post my NovelAi-assisted work on any of the most wellknown fanfiction sites. (I didn't even dare to post this anywhere but here lol, yes I'm a coward, even on the internet-)

Because, even if I would like to share my cringy delusional fanfic daydreams with like-minded people, if all I'm going to get is pure hatred bc of the AI, I feel like I might as well keep it to myself. I honestly really, really love those sites and their communities and have been an avid fan/reader since I was a young teen, but they don't seem the most openminded when it comes to this. 

I've always dabbled in writing but I never posted anything and none of my works ever went past the 25k word mark. I have like 15+ different fics started and unfinished because for some reason I always lost interest or went out of steam after the initial writing burst and then they slowly withered away over the years (idk why, I like to blame my mental health problems for it but maybe I'm just lazy). I'm definitely not the best or most profound writer but I do enjoy rereading my own works a lot, even if they're really unfinished.

When the first chatbots dropped I was ecstatic, I find the whole topic extremely fascinating, bc, as you might've guessed, I'm a rather lonely person and they listened to all my fucking ramblings and specific obsessions without complaint lol.

I discovered NovelAI a few months ago and played around with it but never got anything too concrete bc I wasn't that knowledgeable about how it works and too lazy to learn it at the time. But now, after another writing burst for a new fic in a new fandom I discovered (which I am currently obsessed with), I gave it another try, earnestly reading into the mechanics and giving it my best shot.

I wrote about 17k+ words on my own and again felt myself slowly lose steam in writing, and because I really wanted to see at least one single work of mine finished in my lifetime, I inserted it in there, and it worked out beautifully.

I still have to handheld and guide it a lot, give it my own ideas for the plot (I even made my first ever fully detailed outline for this fic while still in my writing burst, just so I knew where I wanted it to go) and I mostly rewrite/edit what it gives me so it fits, but at least I didn't have another break-off.

It's just so satisfying to see it come together. I pretty much use it as a co-writer for scenes I'm unsure about, so I might write a couple of pages and if I'm stuck get it to write the next scene/page/s before taking over again. By now I managed to make it past the 100k+ words mark and I'm honestly so proud of the fic (even if it's still cringy and not that good objectively). I love seeing my full ideas/daydreams finally come to life and I feel like it's mostly still my own voice/work.

After a cursory glance over some subreddits, my heart dropped and I really felt ashamed for using AI. I do wonder if someday I would've managed to do an entire fic on my own, to have something I am 100% responsible for without artificial help.



Back to the main question, are there any of you out there who proudly post their AI/AI-assisted works on these sites? Does anyone read them? What has the feedback been?

Even though I haven't really seen a lot so far (except for short drabbles and jokey ones), I know I would read those fics as well, at least when the author invested some work and own ideas so that they're interesting/well-written.

I'm just not sure if I should even put my work out in public when it's just going to be blocked and hated by the majority, bc I don't know I have the right mindset for that lol.

I know I know, don't be sensitive, this is the internet and everyone is entitled to their opinions. I can't even bring myself to hate/dislike the people who hate AI (except for the fanatic antis that wish death on people, like wtf) because I do understand some of their sentiments and concerns. But for me, this is like an ancient dream come true. I spend way too much of my time absorbed in these worlds and despite daydreaming all day long I just never managed to finish anything, despite how much I wanted to. 

I never had anyone to talk to about these things and now I have an artificial writing buddy who knows my preferences and can easily help me reenter a flow-state.

Like, my time on this planet is limited anyway and the AI is going to exist whether I use it or not, so I might as well take it for a ride and enjoy it. I just wonder if it'd be best to just keep it to myself because I do have a lot of respect for people who actually are that good at writing full stories on their own (even if they might not believe me after this post).



So yeah, long rambling text aside, I know I can technically post whatever I want as long as it fits the guidelines, but is there any worth for it with the current hateful climate?

12kogoq,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Exploring AI Art: Unlocking Creative Potential and Fostering Inclusivity As a frequent Reddit user who enjoys engaging in discussions and exploring various topics, I recently came across some interesting subreddits that focus on the use of AI in art. These spaces like rDefendingAIArt, raiwars, and others promote lively discussions, varied opinions and showcase the potential of AI-powered creativity.

AI art has been a contentious topic in recent years with many expressing concern about the impact it may have on traditional artists and the art industry as a whole. However, through my experiences in engaging with these communities, I've come to believe that AI art holds significant potential for enabling new forms of expression and creativity, while also providing artists with tools to enhance their own works.

One thing I've discovered is that AI art can actually help artists break through creative block by offering unique and unexpected perspectives. The use of AI in art has shown that these tools can find associations and generate imagery that might not have occurred to human artists on their own. By automating certain time-consuming tasks, AI art generators can save artists valuable time, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their work.

However, the potential benefits of AI in art extend beyond just assisting established artists. It can also democratize creativity by making it accessible to a wider audience. With AI tools, people who may not have had the resources or ability to create traditional art can now express themselves, share their ideas, and contribute to the artistic landscape. This can foster a more inclusive, diverse, and innovative artistic community.

Of course, with any emerging technology, there are potential concerns and drawbacks. In the case of AI art, one issue is the potential for copyright infringement and the misappropriation of original works. It's important for AI developers, users, and the wider community to remain responsible and vigilant in ensuring that the technology is used ethically and fairly.

Ultimately, AI is just another tool in the artist's toolbox, and as with any other tool, its potential lies in the hands of those who wield it. So long as we continue to have open discussions and encourage responsible, ethical use of AI in art, I believe that its positive impact on creativity and expression could outweigh any potential concerns.

Artists can have my sympathy and support, if they don't attack **choices I freely make**. I sympathize with artists' concerns and support the idea of micropayments or royalties for work used in AI training. It's likely never going to happen, capitalism does not give AF about you unless forced to by law. But I'd pay it gladly.



Some of you are joining a long line of people who lose to technology, from the original luddites (manual factory workers) to the bookkeeping clerks, tax preparers, law clerks, typist, advertising agents/agencies, newspaper employees, reporters, print publication photographers, pressmen, typesetters, and that's before we get into all the art jobs previously lost to illustrator/photoshop and all their predecessors.

Do you know what it's like to not be able to draw a circle? Do you know what it's like to not be able to imagine a window with a rounded top and draw it on paper? To be the biggest **loser** in the ENTIRE HISTORY OF PICTIONNARY? It feels like a disability (even I think to those who don have the severity of challenges I have with this.

***What does AI art mean to me?*** 

  
I am a creative type with [aphantasia]( I can't draw anything, visually or electronically,  that doesn't have measurable angles. I have ran businesses for 30+ years, i was only an employee once in all that time. I've needed logos, business cards, post cards, promotional brochures, newspaper adverts, magazine ads, promotional product prints, shirts,  tv screen ads, etc. On the personal side, I get ideas, I contracted someone for a comic panel, I have dm'd roleplaying games all that time and commissioned some related art.

  
About **3 in 300 times** I get something close enough to what I was thinking. About 15 more in those 300 times I get something even better, when it comes to ads/promotional  because people have skills.

Last year I conceived of a piece of art, I typed in 3 prompts into GPT and I got  exactly what I imagined, visually, for the first time in my entire long life.

If I had time, runway would let me make videos I think of when trying to fall asleep, Suno would let me put my lyrics to music for fun. Etc.

  
Do  you know what that means to me? I get to make art. Without your vision being projected onto it, or dictating it all together?

  
The landscape of art creation is changing. While this brings challenges, it also opens doors for those previously excluded from certain forms of creativity. I believe there's room for both AI and human artistry in our future. Let's work together to navigate this new terrain.**. Get good with AI** or be **better than AI** and I'll still hire you. I don't want to spend the time making things for my commercial needs. 

Let me do what I want and I'll still be here for you where I can.

artists can have my sympathy and support, if they don't attack **choices i freely make**. i sympathize with artists' concerns and support the idea of micropayments or royalties for work used in ai training. it's likely never going to happen, capitalism does not give af about you unless forced to by law. but i'd pay it gladly.



some of you are joining a long line of people who lose to technology, from the original luddites (manual factory workers) to the bookkeeping clerks, tax preparers, law clerks, typist, advertising agents/agencies, newspaper employees, reporters, print publication photographers, pressmen, typesetters, and that's before we get into all the art jobs previously lost to illustrator/photoshop and all their predecessors.

do you know what it's like to not be able to draw a circle? do you know what it's like to not be able to imagine a window with a rounded top and draw it on paper? to be the biggest **loser** in the entire history of pictionnary? it feels like a disability (even i think to those who don have the severity of challenges i have with this.

***what does ai art mean to me?*** 

  
i am a creative type with [aphantasia]( i can't draw anything, visually or electronically,  that doesn't have measurable angles. i have ran businesses for 30+ years, i was only an employee once in all that time. i've needed logos, business cards, post cards, promotional brochures, newspaper adverts, magazine ads, promotional product prints, shirts,  tv screen ads, etc. on the personal side, i get ideas, i contracted someone for a comic panel, i have dm'd roleplaying games all that time and commissioned some related art.

  
about **3 in 300 times** i get something close enough to what i was thinking. about 15 more in those 300 times i get something even better, when it comes to ads/promotional  because people have skills.

last year i conceived of a piece of art, i typed in 3 prompts into gpt and i got  exactly what i imagined, visually, for the first time in my entire long life.

if i had time, runway would let me make videos i think of when trying to fall asleep, suno would let me put my lyrics to music for fun. etc.

  
do  you know what that means to me? i get to make art. without your vision being projected onto it, or dictating it all together?

  
the landscape of art creation is changing. while this brings challenges, it also opens doors for those previously excluded from certain forms of creativity. i believe there's room for both ai and human artistry in our future. let's work together to navigate this new terrain.**. get good with ai** or be **better than ai** and i'll still hire you. i don't want to spend the time making things for my commercial needs. 

let me do what i want and i'll still be here for you where i can.

1fqm0qm,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"""Soul of art"" aka qualia When Antis talk about ""AI is soulles"" they go after ages old psychological discussion of qualia. Meaning that things (like emotions, feelings or even sensory perception) have some special part that cannot be conveyed by mere description, but must be directly experienced to be understood. As AI is not human, it doesn't have ability to perceive that qualia, and argument is that ""art can't exist without qualia"". But then we can ask - what qualia make fantasy art? Or furry art? What you necessarily need to perceive first to draw dragon. Not mention what expectation of perceive people would have toward some NSFW art. Do all those artists perceived that personally (if yes, then I would call police for case of animal abuse)? What qualia is need and necessary to make art? What about abstract art? Do it need direct precieving of world as well? We can draw things from imagination - without qualia. But when AI put same ""imagination"" part on emotional load of picture, overstepping need of qualia - it is immediately ""soulless slop"". For me what counts - us what viewer see. Humans have ability to see beauty in random patterns. Saying that something can't be art because wasn't made by ""human hand"" is going against viewer. After all - saying goes - ""beauty is in the eye of beholder"". It's not way something was done, making something worthwhile art, not some qualia of emotion (there can be art that was done in extreme emotion, yet still be seem by most as bad art), but simply what viewers think about it.

10cbc52,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"The term ""Synthography"" makes total sense of the entire AI art 'debate' The term ""Synthography"" has been gaining a lot of traction, and upon some self-reflection and using the term to define the process of generating AI images, everything started to make sense.

Let's step back a bit.

Back in the day, there was much heated debate regarding the emergence of photography and how it would spoil traditional painting. 

""Is photography real art?""

""Photography doesn't require the same rigorous education as painting does!""

""Anybody can pickup a camera and take a picture of a landscape with neither soul nor talent!""

""Painting has soul, photography is soulless""

""Photography will kill painting!""

These sort of statements don't make any sense today - painting isn't ""dead"", it's an entirely different medium from photography. And we all know photography itself is a legitimate artistic medium and requires talent, skill, technical and conceptual knowledge, a unique creative workflow, and is a profession in its own right.

Sure, photography may have killed a lot of the mass market of painting. Nobody hires a painter for their wedding - you hire a photographer. Painting thus became more niche, but it's still here.

--

Now let's think about what's happening today with AI.

For one, this ""debate"" has been framed very poorly and is strife with lack of information, misinformation, and unfaithful argumentation. 

A good way to frame the debate is that it isn't a debate about artists and AI - it's actually a debate about illustration and Synthography. 

""Is synthography real art?""

""Synthography doesn't require the same rigorous skillset as illustration does!""

""Anybody can use AI and generate a picture with neither soul nor talent""

""Synthography will kill painting!""

Although Synthography is a very new medium and it can be difficult to predict how it's going to shape up, we need to make a bit of differentiation on its users. 

Bear with me for just a moment, because I'm going No True Scotsman - trust me it will make sense.

A light user of AI image generation, let's call them a prompt-jockey (saw that term used elsewhere might be fitting in this context). A prompt-jockey may use an AI model, insert some simple prompts, take the output image, and be happy with the result.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with that obviously, but there is going to be a **huge** difference between a prompt-jockey and a Synthographer, and that gap will quickly increase in the coming years.

Think of the difference between:

A layperson who takes photos with their iPhone camera
**vs.**
A professional photographer who owns many lenses, utilizes extensive editing, has deep knowledge of the field, etc.

The former is having fun but it'd be ridiculous to say that they are an actual photographer.

Likewise think of a person who casually makes doodles in a sketchbook
**vs.**
A professional digital illustrator with years of practice, a large art portfolio, a complete software workflow, etc.

The same will be true for prompt-jockeys who are prompt-doodling (proodling?) vs. the professional synthographer.

--

So what does the professional synthographer of the future look like?

Well their skillset and creative workflow may look like this:

* Extensive knowledge about the latest AI models, which ones to use for which specific task, technical ability to tweak models as needed, etc.
* Adept at using prompts. The professional synthographer will likely go through dozens of images tweaking things along the way until a satisfactory result - and this all may just be one small piece of the final product
* Technical skills in other tools such as Photoshop for further editing, fine-tuning, etc.
* Bonus: may even have extensive theoretical and technical knowledge about art history, photography, and various techniques for use in prompts

The job of the professional synthographer may be full-time in a workplace, off commissions, or independent creating their own work.

The role of the professional synthographer becomes very interesting once you take into account the advances in audio, video, and 3-D synthography in the near future. The general synthographer will become a complex role that utilizes a wide skillset to create multimedia creations that affect the full audiovisual spectrum. I'd wager that in the future there would be sub-specialist synthographers as the medium becomes increasingly complex.

Now when we think about the role of the synthographer, it starts to make no sense to **not** describe them as artists. These are going to be *individuals utilizing a medium to create something that originated as a creative concept in someone's mind*. This is an artist by definition.

It is true that a lot of digital illustrators today are going to lose their jobs and income from the rise of Synthography. Synthography is almost certainly poised to takeover the mass market - the vast majority of businesses and consumers will be utilizing Synthography in the near future.

Yeah the debate is brimming with misinformation, lack of information, and outrage typical of most things debated on the internet as everything becomes a culture war flashpoint in this day and age.

But make no mistake that Synthography is going to be *massive* and the first generation of leaders in the field of Synthography are being made *right now*. In fact many illustrators are dabbling in Synthography as you read this right now. These illustrators have a massive leg up from laypersons just getting into the field with no prior knowledge. Why? Illustrators can make use of their creativity, extensive artistic knowledge, and their talent for getting skilled at an artistic medium. Not just that, but illustrators can always use their skill in say a future professional setting (e.g. using illustrations to create proof-of-concepts and blending that into their workflow).

14roh05,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Deleted on AIWars, The future of AI, from a retired freelancer animator  Just let me preface this, I was one of the ones against AI in the beginning when it was not as mature and I also used it at that stage, I'm still against it but at the same time i'm not, BUT you CAN NOT stop technological progress.

I've worked as a freelancer animator for the last four years, started using SFM and then migrated to Blender, learned a lot in the proccess, no schools or anything like that, merely using tutorials on youtube and for problems that aren't as easy to fix I had to dig deeper to find the solutions, when I started leak sites aren't was common, I somewhat did prosper a bit, afterwards leak sites started to appear, but i still keep strong, then AI came, it flood the social network i've used (Pixiv), and then i was one if not the first that would call for the eventual destruction of the website because it would A) be flooded with AI and B) be flooded with actual child porn, both became true

With both AI and Leaking sites becoming more and more rampant my income (and of many others) started to decrease, but that was already predictable, but what I've not predicted was that Art on itself would start become more 'soulless', this hit me, and hard, yesterday as I was scrolling on a site dedicated to creating AI Models, i've noticed that things that four years ago would take the most skilled artists to create it would take me less than 40 minutes to make using Blender and Stable Diffusion, this is someone with very basic drawing skills, i enjoy using it because i can finally put most of my imagination on 'paper', but i can also see where it is all leading, and it is a extremly dark future for artists in general, specially 'purists' who refuce to drop traditional art or even learn 3D softwares, why? heres why

1. **1. With AI maturing at the pace it is more and more companies will start firing their artists and animators and replacing then with software engineers and anyone who has experience with AI in general, reducing their workforce by at least 80% but still profiting as much.**
2. **2. When AI is mature enough Artists will now have in their contracts to give their likeness and voice to train models, rendering then useless in future works, think Mark Hamill and Darth Vader voice, the 'average' consumer is there for nostalgia, he does not care who is there as long it looks good, and major companies know that, and they will exploit that.**
3. **3. Like every major inovation that aims to replace certain people or make a labor easier this one is no different, look in the past and see how many people lost their jobs to machinery, and now look at the future and see how many people will lose theirs for technology and robotics, if you don't have a high degree in anything meaningful, you my friend, is in for a rude weakning.**
4. **4. A hard decline in 'Big Dogs', now that everyone and their mom can use AI, multi-milionaries like Sakimichan, DarkCookie and InCase will become irrelevant, i've seen art ten times as good being created by AI, the art world will be filled with 'perfect' art where every art is perfect, art will be devalutated and there will be no longer a point in setting a Patreon page as good art is no longer hidden behind a commission or a paywall and even the 'niche' artists will fall in obscurity, in less than ten years people will be using old porn animations to create animations using their favorite characters or celebrities**
5. **5. People who aren't native english speakers will be able to create youtube channels simply typing their scrips and sharing their opnions with the world**
6. **6. There is no future without the first baby steps, what we currently experiencing is the beginning of the 'cyberpunk' age, AI will be improved to the point that it will be used to design the first brain implants and bionic arms like the one in MGSTPP, in the next 200 years AI will be in the lives of every single human on earth, from self driving vehicles to the eventual creating of sex bots, which will replace prostitutes and hookers (wish the last one would happen in my time lol, want to see these thots out of business)**
7. **7. AI Artists will procude more but get paid less as they will be easily replaced unlike good artists in the past, art creating in the future will be more limited by GPU speed and which AI software is better**
8. **8. there is now hundreds of Patreon accounts with AI Art that have more than 200 images in their Portofilo being less than 1 month old, yet these same accounts who are producing content superior to the best artist from four years ago are making less than 1% percent of that same artist**
9. **9. The data is there, stoping creating works will NOT prevent future models from being created, there an almost unlimited amount of media to be consumed to create models (from SFM and Blender animations to even OLD MOVIES), simply checking a box on deviantart wont prevent a user to create a model using that work, it is like piracy, does saying that watching a torrented movie is illegal? it does, but does it stop people from torrenting it?**
10. **10. Some movies predicted everything that is happening and will happen, is just a question of when and not IF.**
11. **11. Third Worlders that are somewhat 'famous' artists will be hit harder as the amount they make will become even less compared to their First World counterparts, some already went on meltdowns on twitter as their livehood is being directly affected by this, what is left is having a average job that will pay less but demands you to work less, not much of a problem in the first World as the salary is somewhat better, but trading a chair and a monitor and the ability to take 'smoke breaks' any time you want is not something many artists are willing to do, this will create a major depression crisis amongst artists**

I've disabled all my accounts, patreon, paypal, twittcer, dA, you name it, as i know creating art for the sake of making money for a living is no longer a reality, and you should do the same, either create for fun or do not create at all, it is a sad reality for artists? it is. Can ANYTHING be done to change it? no.

I'm Pro-AI or Anti-AI? neither, i am however, a realist, i know that independtly of my actions nothing will change and I have to adapt, i know it is hard, but trust me it has to be done, otherwise you will enter in despair and carry hatred for the mere mention of the word 'AI'.

19eymqe,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Were any of you pro AI art before 2021/2022? So to make a long story short I was totally on board with AI art like around 2015. Like way before this whole thing blew up. I watched a video and the video basically said that AI can make art but only if we let it and I thought this was a cool thing. There was this thing called deep dreaming AI or it was a deep dreaming AI generator and I would totally give a link to this except that I don't want it to give me nightmares and it is kind of creepy. Basically what it does is it takes an image like the Mona Lisa and then just starts putting a bunch of faces all over it. It's a little creepy and it was AI generated but it was very basic. Basically it was just trying to look for patterns and then start generating images into those patterns.

At the time I thought it was pretty cool and when the video basically said that AI can make art but only if we let it I was totally on board with this idea of AI one day being able to make art.

I also watched a video at one point by CGP Gray and CGP Gray also mentioned that computers might one day be able to make art and in fact they kind of already were sort of. The technology is probably a lot heavier than it is now but even back then AI was kind of making art kind of. It certainly was making music and it was also making words.

But now for some reason it's different. I don't know. I was really excited about the idea of this new type of artist.

I thought art was about the idea of making people happy and bringing joy to the world which I think is something that AI has the power to do.

But instead all I get is a bunch of proof that artists are just elitists.

I knew that they existed to some degree but I thought that the whole idea about art was that there was no one way art could be.

This was during the time when Dall E was probably the best at creating images. Prior to the video, Jazza had gone to his twitter or IG and asked people to give him prompts

To cut to the chase, he would then put those prompts through Dall E, and also go to Fiverr and hire different artists to create images based on these prompts

I will say that the AI imagining didn't blow me away, but it seemed to at least have some idea of what was wanted

One of the prompts was 'An astronaut in a Renaissance painting style'  Dall E did an okay job with it

The artist that was hired however? He did an okay job, except as Jazza pointed out, he had used a reference image, as in blatantly copied it, and it was not in a Renaissance style

The absolute worst were the artists hired to paint a unicorn running across a rainbow in the style of Carvagio

The first artist painted the rainbow, but when it came to the unicorn they just grabbed it from a google image search, did some slight tweaks and slapped it on there.  Iirc, Jazza paid like $180 for this one

Then there was the artist that pretty much just grabbed a screen shot from a ""how to paint a rainbow"" video, and also slapped on unicorn found using a google image search. Cost for this was also over $150

The one artist that actually did a good job, digitally painted the image without relying on google images, and also followed the part of ""in the style of Carvagio"" only charged $85

  
Antis love to moan and groan about how AI grabs all these images from the internet and magically combines them into a collaged image. (Which is not how AI imaging works) This video showed that some artists are prone to actual taking of images and collaging them.

113fonu,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Copyright law, Andersen et al, and moving AI art into the future I've been using stable diffusion for just under a month now and I'm totally in love with it, I am also in love with all the fine-tuned checkpoints, LoRAs, Hypernetworks, and Textual Inversion that the community is cranking out, this is art bliss for me personally and the only thing I hate is that my GPU hardware is a bit dated and slow to crank through art or do my own fine-tuning.

I've been following the Andersen et al lawsuit against Stability.ai, and also reading some of the counter arguments against AI art.   


It really seems like their primary argument against it is the fact that the LAION 5B data set contains some copyrighted material that didn't get explicit permission first to be used as training data, the other arguments whining that ""AI gonna steal artists jerbs"" really seems unrealistic and fear-mongering. I get that artists are concerned, AI is coming for my job too (programmer), but I'm choosing to embrace it and get good with the tool rather than be scared of it and watch as the world passes me by. Also, the models as they exist now are like a huge advertisement for the artists whose names get used to produce awesome works... sorry about the free advertising, fame and notoriety?  


From my perspective it seems this whole argumentation in the lawsuit brought by Andersen can be short-circuited by training a new base model using an image set of images that the artists and photographers have either given explicit permission or have opted in to the data set. Given that almost everyone has a digital camera and is connected to the internet, it seems like a big task but we could collectively attack it like a school of piranha eating a cow carcass, we just need an organizing framework to guide us.  


Wouldn't it be possible for us to get together, pool our resources, and build a 100% open-source base model with a complete paper trail of opt-in art? I know the tech hardware is a limiting factor to getting that done, but if the lawsuits end up dismantling the existing companies that have provided the base models ([Stability.ai]( OpenAI, and Midjourney), we're going to end up doing this anyway if we want to push AI art forward.

wouldn't it be possible for us to get together, pool our resources, and build a 100% open-source base model with a complete paper trail of opt-in art? i know the tech hardware is a limiting factor to getting that done, but if the lawsuits end up dismantling the existing companies that have provided the base models ([stability.ai]( openai, and midjourney), we're going to end up doing this anyway if we want to push ai art forward.

1adl00m,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"Topic of AI NSFW images of celebrities being ""Revenge Porn"" Does anyone else find the claim that AI porn of real people, particularly people like celebrities or streamers, is somehow equal to or on the same level of actual revenge porn, to be absurd?

There's a post on a popular echo-chamber subbreddit I had the misfortune of seeing about a woman discovering her boyfriend made a few images of some streamers with an nsfw model.  Images she specifically makes clear he didn't share or have any interest in sharing with anyone.

The replies to this post are incredibly over-the-top.  People saying things like ""he's definitely lying and shares this"" or ""he has 100% made AI porn of you and your friends"" or ""he clearly doesn't understand consent and will probably rape you"" or ""this is one of those red flags you see in true crime documentaries where a man murders his partner""

This is just completely ridiculous to me. Am I missing something here? Because to me, privately making some obviously fake image of a public figure doing something sexual is not only a far cry from intentionally releasing real pornographic images of someone you know personally without consent, but a million miles away from any kind of actual abuse, or violence.

There was a comparision to some creep in his attic cutting out pictures of his secret crush and pasting them on playboy and this being essentially the same thing.  People agree with this comparision.  How?

The problem with revenge porn is that it is non-censensually released content that shows an indivual actually being intimate.  It's bad because it's REAL.  The reason consent is the focus is because that's what makes it a question of ethics, obviously.  But if it's fake?  It's just insulting to say that's the same.

I feel like it's fair to say it's creepy, gross, and potentially unethical, but to put this on the same level as REVENGE PORN?  It just doesn't make sense.  People are acting like this is far worse than it is and I don't get it.

The Taylor Swift thing is being compared to ""The Fappening"" ffs.  


Am I wrong?  


Keep in mind, we are talking about a single solitary dude privately making a botched fake of a popular streamer and not doing anything with it.  These reactions are not to someone harassing someone, claiming it's real, making threats, intentionally distributing the images, making images and intentionally showing it to the person, and not about making AI NSFW of minor or personal IRL connections.

1d9i2ju,DefendingAIArt,critical_discussion,"An Art definition I made that is 100% compatible with AI and anything previous to AI Hello everyone, not that long time ago I made this document where I conceived an Art definition that probably is the best one I can think of to this date, is called *metautilitarism.*

  
The most interesting thing about this definition, is that it has an experiment where it proves the true definition of art creation. As you will see, this destroys 100% the definitions and arguments of creation that anti-AI artists make. There's also more concepts where you can see clearly how Art as a phenomenon is composed, being one of them *Sector A and Sector B of artists.*

The entire document where it explains everything about metautilitarism you can read it [here]( While I'm gonna post here the experiment I designed myself. The source code of this experiment/game you can find it [here.](https://github.com/somegreg89/the_experiment_of_art_creation/) 

The conclusion of everything is: art creation was always about the authority of decision making, not matter what you use or how you do it for it.

=== The Experiment of Art Creation  
It is a simple game that has the following rules:

* There is a ball that starts at a random position, this ball moves in a straight trajectory and bounces when it reaches some corner of the screen, the bouncing occurs at random angles.
* When you press a button, the ball will start to draw its path, or in case it bounces, it will move the line along with it. When you stop pressing the button, the ball leaves the line at the position where you stopped pressing the button.

The goal is to draw whatever you please until you think you are done drawing what you wanted.

You can play this experiment yourself and test my hypothesis. Although I warn you, it will take some patience and you are limited to making straight lines.

When you finish the drawing, ask yourself the following questions:

1. Who caused the line?
2. Who decided about the line?
3. What caused that set of decisions?

I will try to answer the questions myself.

1. I am not the one who caused the line, I know this because a line needs movement to take place, and I am not the one who controls that movement, therefore, the line is caused by the ball. Or to be more specific, the line is caused by the computer.
2. Clearly I am the one who decides about the line, with the button I assign where it starts and where it ends.
3. My decisions about where the line start and end caused what I had defined in my mind: a house, man or car.

No matter how hard you try to spin this experiment to find an alternative explanation, it will fail. \[...\]

  
There are certain observations that should be documented here when you do this experiment:

1. If you improvise the drawing, your mind starts to relate other figures such lines which you have to decide which of all possible figures to choose to give a new direction to your drawing.
2. If you make an accident or inaccuracy, you decide to keep the accident or get rid of it.
3. You always decide whether to leave the drawing as it is or continue to add details until you are satisfied with the result. It always ends up being a decision to declare when a work of art is finished. If you continue to be dissatisfied, you will continue as long as you can stand it.

As you can read in the observations of the experiment, it all comes down to decisions from the beginning to the end of a work, and the work is declared to exist when you deliberately decide that it is finished. And these decisions have absolutely nothing to do with you being the cause of such materialization of the work.

Here a speedpaint/demonstration trying to draw a Car.

As you can see, this is exactly what it happens every time someone uses AI to create art (yes, they are creating by this point) because they always decide everything about what it should have and what it shouldn't have based on personal metrics (pre-art conditions).

Hope you find interesting this or if you have some observations/questions, please comment them. Thanks!
