**GitHub**: [https://github.com/lichao-sun/Mora](https://github.com/lichao-sun/Mora)

**Abstract**:

>Sora is the first large-scale generalist video generation model that garnered significant attention across society. Since its launch by OpenAI in February 2024, no other video generation models have paralleled Sora's performance or its capacity to support a broad spectrum of video generation tasks. Additionally, there are only a few fully published video generation models, with the majority being closed-source. To address this gap, this paper proposes a new multi-agent framework **Mora**, which incorporates several advanced visual AI agents to replicate generalist video generation demonstrated by Sora. In particular, Mora can utilize multiple visual agents and successfully mimic Sora's video generation capabilities in various tasks, such as (1) text-to-video generation, (2) text-conditional image-to-video generation, (3) extend generated videos, (4) video-to-video editing, (5) connect videos and (6) simulate digital worlds. Our extensive experimental results show that Mora achieves performance that is proximate to that of Sora in various tasks. However, there exists an obvious performance gap between our work and Sora when assessed holistically. In summary, we hope this project can guide the future trajectory of video generation through collaborative AI agents.","mora: enabling generalist video generation via a multi-agent framework  *paper**: [

Kim Jung Gi, also known on the web as Superani, was famous for his large scale public illustration sessions, some of which you can watch on his [Youtube-channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/superani/videos). In those videos you can see an illustrator working without any sketches or scribbles, generating an image out of his own mind, transcoding an idea in his head right onto a canvas. His skill in these regards was outstanding and absolutely unique.

With Kim Jung Gi, the illustration world looses one of the greats of the contemporary illustration world and who influenced a ton of people with his passion for style and work.

 A few days after his death, this happened: 

https://preview.redd.it/cdgnxlsc2rs91.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d2350731124ebb652e529d29dfa7f547e6e7199

There is a lot to say about this.

While I do think that AI models trained on styles by specific artist will become a commercial product in the form of modular components for ai based illustration software in the very near future, I also think that it’s very bad style to train an AI model on the style of artists who died a day ago. This is just not something decent thinking humans do.

A few weeks ago I [wrote](https://goodinternet.substack.com/p/eine-ethik-mimetischer-ai-modelle) about a paper presenting a new framework to think about these cases. In [Mimetic Models: Ethical Implications of AI that Acts Like You](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09394) explore cases where the creation of AI models that act like a specific person can reflect back on reputations or influence outcomes in the job market. This specific case seems to be one of the first cases of what i called a “Pirate Mimetic AI-Model”, where someone just mindlessly trained a model on the work of one person and generated a wobbly, unreliable imitation from it.

I have my suspicions about the motivations here, not to mention the [AI art trolls](https://twitter.com/DannyAraya/status/1578549605947813888), but I will cut the guy some slack and believe that this was done to honor the deceased artist.

Then there are also people who [dunk](https://twitter.com/danielwarren86/status/1578536701911502850) on this misguided attempt by dismissing AI generated art alltogether as “soulless and cheap (…) next to the real art by the real artist”.

Though i agree with the overall sentiment in this specific case, the aesthetic stength of image synthesis is *not* the imitation of specific artists (yet). While I can generate thousands of James Jeans in a few hours, they have nothing to next compared to the real thing. This is true (for now).

The strength of these stochastic libraries is not that, but generating *unknown unknowns*. Its especially the strange mutations and the weird stuff that is unique and interesting about this new stochastic visual style. The uncanniness and the surprise is exactly what makes the experience of AI art distinct from all other art forms, maybe with exceptions for live performances and action painting, where stochastic and random elements go into the experience of the piece itself.

I more and more think about these AI art models not as technologies to produce singular pieces of artworks, but as pieces of art themselves. The latent spaces of every AI model is a compression of symbolic representations into a few gigabytes of data, a technological artifact that we have yet no definitive language to talk about. I don’t think these models are “intelligent” in any sense of that word. They are [a new form of cultural technology akin to writing, print or libraries](https://goodinternet.substack.com/p/wishful-mnemonics), and in the case of compressed art, they summarize a whole human visual history.

I consider these models themselves a piece of art, done by a whole collective of engineers and scientists, data scrapers and the prompters, the explorers of latent space. All of this is one giant piece of art and we are only starting to explore it. I like the new school tech romanticism this perspective attaches to a debate that speaks about supposedly “soulless” and “synthetic” visual imagery, where actually its a new form of experience that is just at the beginning stages of development. Remember that all of this technology is 10 years old, and image synthesis really started to become usable *a few weeks ago*.

In one year, artists will be able to license AI modules for Photoshop “in the style of Greg Rutkowski”, and maybe even Kim Jung Gi, too, given that in an [interview in 2018](https://visualatelier8.com/kim-jung-gi-visual-atelier-8/), he had this to say, speaking pretty approvingly about technological progress, AI and art:

&gt;Many people are talking more and more about the development of AI (Artificial Intelligence) such as Alpha-Go and the influence they will have on our future lives. And the advancement in internet and technology will broaden our ways to express ourselves, and eventually it will have direct and indirect influence in the art realm as well. The art world will be shown in many different forms or in the artworks themselves. I myself have experienced VR (Virtual Reality) first hand. It was a very good experience to me as an artist, and I remember that the audience also seem to be having a good time. The films are also awakening our senses even more and I look forward to their advancement. **I believe the development of new and diverse ways of expressing and new forms of art paradigm due to advancement in technology will make our lives more diverse and interesting.** And after some time, when people are tired of these things, they can always go back to doing things in traditional format.

I believe, however misguided this attempt at honoring a deceased artist may have been, Kim Jung Gi would have embraced the existence of these image synthesizers which function as stochastic libraries and provide new ways of access to art history.

When I take one thing from Kim Jung Gis work and interviews, then that he loved *making audiences experience art*. If AI-based systems can do exactly this in new ways, as wonky and unprecise the results may be at this point, he may have liked it.

These models *do* produce new imagery, new interesting forms, provide new ways to experince art and are, thus, aesthetically interesting. They have their place in the always evolving art space and Kim Jung understood this.

So, goodnight, Kim, and thanks for all the drawings.

◡̈ Useful Things To Use Down Below. These Are All Taken From The Big Book Of Prompts And Reddit (NOT OC) ◡̈

# Photographic films: 

FYI: adding word ""sample"" after the brand of film, filters out branded cameras, packaging and rolls of film, from being used during image generation. Prompt modifier examples: ""as fujicolor sample"", ""as rollei sample"" 

Source: 

Listed below in alphabetical order, are widespread photographic films that work well when prompted, with brief descriptions so you know what to expect from these. 

Cinestill - Color photos with fine/low grain and higher than average resolution. Depending on photography subject, colors are slightly oversaturated or slightly desaturated. Origin: USA. Prompt modifier: ""cinestill"", ""as cinestill"", ""as cinestill sample"" 

Ektachrome - Color photos with fine/low to moderate grain. Depending on photography subject, colors will be on either colder part of spectrum or regular, with normal or slightly higher saturation. Overall very similar to Kodachrome. Manufactured by Kodak. Origin: USA. Prompt modifier: ""as ektachrome sample"" 

Ektar - Modern brand of Kodak film. Color photos with little to no grain. Results generally look like regular modern photography with artistic angles. Origin: USA. Prompt modifier: ""as ektar sample"" 

Film Washi - This brand has lower chance to work as expected when prompted, it seems to prefer landscapes, cities and buildings. Results are great when it works though. Mostly black and white photos with fine/low to moderate grain. Occasionally gives colored photos with low saturation. Distinct style with high black contrast and soft camera lens effect. Origin: France / Russia. Prompt modifier: ""as film washi sample"" 

Fomapan - Black and white photos based on film by legendary Foma Bohemia aka Fotochema. Features fine/low to moderate grain, highly artistic exposure and angles. Depending on photography subject adds very soft lens effect without distortion, dark photo vignette. Origin: Czech Republic. Prompt modifier: ""as fomapan sample"" 

Fujicolor - Color photos with fine/low to moderate grain. Image resolution varies depending on photography subject, colors are slightly or notably desaturated, with entire color hue shifted in a very distinct manner. Manufactured by Fujifilm. Origin: Japan. Prompt modifier: ""fujicolor"", ""as fujicolor"", ""as fujicolor sample"" 

Fujifilm - As this is a general manufacturer name, results vary greatly depending on the photo subject, with data set including all related and even unrelated varieties of film. Photos can be either colored or black and white. Amount of grain, color saturation, contrast, color or lack of it is seemingly random. Prefers lower color saturation and brightness with landscapes. Origin: Japan. Prompt modifier: ""as fujifilm sample"" 

Holga - Color photos with moderate to fine/low grain. Similar to Lomography in style, but with a lot less grain. Good chance to get black and white photography depending on subject. Color saturation varies greatly, from regular saturation, to slight oversaturation or close to black and white desaturation. Origin: Czech Republic. Prompt modifier: ""as holga film"", ""as holga film sample"" 

ilford - Black and white photos with fine/low to moderate grain. Depending on photography subject adds lens effect, sometimes without distortion, dark photo vignette. Unlike Fomapan, appears to have shorter exposure and lower contrast. Origin: United Kingdom. Prompt modifier: ""as ilford sample"" 

instax - Instant color photos identical to Polaroid but clearer image most of time. Generated results seem to produce much higher quality photos compared to Polaroid - depending on the subject it has near perfect colors, regular saturation, fine/low to medium grain. Manufactured by Fujifilm. Origin: Japan. Prompt modifier: ""as instax"", ""as instax sample"", ""as instax film sample"" 

Lomography - Color photos with high grain. Low chance of black and white photography, unless specifically prompted. Colors are either very oversaturated or slightly desaturated. Distinct contrast of black. Photographic vignette is often applied, creating visual effect of camera lens. Origin: USA / Germany / Czech Republic. Prompt modifier: ""lomography"", ""as lomography"", ""as expired lomography"", ""as lomography sample"" 

Kodachrome - Color photos with moderate grain. Depending on photography subject, colors will be on either colder part of spectrum or regular, with normal or slightly higher saturation. Manufactured by Kodak. Origin: USA. Prompt modifier: ""kodachrome"", ""as kodachrome"", ""as kodachrome sample"" 

Kodak - As this is a general manufacturer name, results vary greatly depending on the photo subject, with data set including all related and even unrelated varieties of film. Photos can be either colored or black and white. Amount of grain, color saturation, contrast, color or lack of it is seemingly random. Prefers lower color saturation and brightness with landscapes. Origin: USA. Prompt modifier: ""as kodak sample"", ""as kodak film sample"" 

Polaroid - Classic instant color photos. As data set contains old photos from 1970's, resulting images are often blurry, with high amount of grain and desaturated colors - the style is rather distinct. Blur can be intensified by applying ""blurry"" modifier keyword. Depending on the subject, gives regular image quality instant photos. Try instax if you wish to get clearer image. Origin: USA. Prompt modifier: ""polaroid"", ""as polaroid"", ""as polaroid photo"", ""as polaroid sample"", ""as polaroid film sample"" 

Rollei - Mostly black and white photos and depending on subject - color photos with fine/low grain. Amount of grain, color saturation, contrast, color or lack of it is seemingly random, as this film is manufactured in different countries and has many varieties. Photos can be sepia colored, or have very unusual hues and desaturation. The brand is over 100 years old, so this variety does magic to landscapes. Origin: Germany, Belgium, United Kingdom, Czech Republic. Prompt modifier: ""as rollei sample"" Early photography techniques: 

Daguerreotype - The first ever publicly available photographic process of 1840's with image developed on silver coated metal plates. When prompted, will most likely produce a black and white photograph in fancy vintage frame to protect the photo as historically it was very fragile and easy to smudge the image with a touch. Another feature is possible lack of clouds unless specifically prompted. Prompt modifier: ""daguerreotype"", ""as daguerreotype"", ""as daguerreotype photo"" 

Calotype - The rival of Daguerreotype process, with image being developed on silver coated paper. If prompted, will most likely produce sepia photographs with very soft shadows. Gets fun when used with anachronisms. Prompt modifier: ""calotype"", ""as calotype"", ""as calotype photo"" 

Ambrotype - The successor of Daguerreotype process, where silver coated metal sheet got replaced with a silver coated piece of glass. Still very fragile historically, so when prompted you'll get vintage frames by default most of time, but not always. Prompt modifier: ""ambrotype"", ""as ambrotype"", ""as ambrotype photo"" 

Albumen print - The successor to all earlier processes, with images being developed on paper with help of silver, rotten eggs, salt and bunch of other chemicals in 1850's up until 1910's.* When prompted, you'll get classic look sepia photography, typical for steampunk. Prompt modifier: ""albumen print"", ""as albumen print"" 

Pinhole photo - A photo taken without lens, through camera obscura phenomenon, with as little as a matchbox with a hole in the side that can be used as a camera. Method used since 1850's up to this day, with peak popularity around 1930s. Will give image a unique, foggy, low detail, historic photograph look. Prompt modifier: ""as pinhole photo"", ""pinhole photography"", ""camera obscura image"" Color types and effects: 

Anaglyph - Originally, a historical technique for producing stereoscopic 3D images from 1850's and to modern day, with image outlined or generally consisting of two chromatically opposite colors. Dall-E 2 doesn't produce perfect anaglyph images (yet) but the 3D effect is there nonetheless if you have the color glasses. The coloring of generated images is interesting on its own. Prompt modifier: ""anaglyph"", ""anaglyph photo"" 

Autochrome - Early color photography process introduced by legendary Lumière brothers in early 1900s, with dyed grains of potato starch used as color filters. Pink, red and various shades of green will dominate over the rest of colors when prompted, orange and blue tones will be faded or nonexistent. Results are fantastic when used on any object, and interesting when combined with earlier photography (e.g. ""autochrome photo of 1860s farmer""). Prompt modifier: ""autochrome"", ""autochrome photo"", ""as autochrome photo"" 

Black and white - As simple as that, with entire image consisting of black, white and various shades of gray. Can be used in combination with colored film, or daily objects for professional artistic photography feel. Prompt modifier: ""black and white photo"", ""as black and white photo"" 

Color photo - While majority of photos have color by default, this modifier allows to combine effects of black and white film with color, or produce unique color combinations when used on something that is supposed to be colorless, such as subjects of 19th century photography. Prompt modifier: ""color photo"", ""colored photo"", ""as colored photo"" 

Holography - A complex process of creating autostereoscopic 3D images, usually used as protection measure on banknotes and official documents. The images look like shifting rainbow of colors as the image consists of many layers (I don't think I can give a brief description of wavefront and light interference), thus when used in a prompt, a resulting image will have the most unexpected colors, as hard to describe psychedelic digital glitch glowing something. Prompt modifier: ""holography of"", ""as holography"" 

Infrared - Light with longer wavelength than visible light (humans can't see it, though some living organisms can). There are special camera sensors that are sensitive to infrared light, and infrared cut-off filters to specifically block visible light close to infrared wavelengths. When used in prompt, will either give you unusual otherworldly colors (usually shades of red, pink, beige, and negative colors) caused by entire range of infrared associated phenomena, or unusual black and white images. Infrared is also related to night vision and thermal imaging, but chance of thermal image effect is low unless specifically prompted as described below. Prompt modifier: ""infrared photo of"", ""as infrared photo"" 

Negative - Image with reversed colors in which the lightest areas of the photographed subject appear darkest and the darkest areas appear lightest. A historical foundation of photographic processes. When used in prompt, depending on the subject and the prompt modifier details, resulting images will have negative colors, possibly inverted black and white, or color negatives of various tones, sometimes with ominous look and blue glow. The image may also come out as mostly normal with some negative colors in its elements. Prompt modifier: ""negative colors"", ""negative color"", ""negative color image"", ""negative color image of"", ""as negative color image"", ""negative photo"", ""negative photo of"", ""as negative photo"" 

Night vision - An ability to see in the dark (actually low light) conditions by using invisible parts of light spectrum. While surroundings appear dark to humans, some living organisms, usually predator animals are able to see clearly in infrared or ultraviolet light wavelengths. Usually associated with green glow of night-vision devices or black and white look of infrared trail cameras and video surveillance / cctv footage. Prompt modifier: ""night vision"", ""night-vision"", ""night vision photo"", ""night vision photo of"", ""as night vision photo"", ""night vision image"", ""night vision image of"", ""as night vision image"" 

Thermography - Thermal imaging is created by capturing infrared radiation emitted by warm objects. Commonly used by military, police, hunters, construction workers and as natural mechanism of some animals to detect heat sources. When prompted, the resulting image will have radically unnatural, crazy colors that might look very stylish depending on the subject. Prompt modifier: ""thermography"", ""thermography of"", ""as thermography"", ""thermal image"", ""thermal image of"", ""as thermal image"" ""thermal photo of"", ""as thermal photo"" 

Ultraviolet - An opposite to infrared, light with shorter wavelength than visible light (humans can't see it, though some living organisms can). It's effects are associated with fluorescent paints and ""what sun really does to your skin"". When prompted will create images with strong deep violet glow, or acidic fluorescent colors glowing under UV lamps. Will rarely generate black and white image with unusual contrast depending on the subject. Prompt modifier: ""ultraviolet photo of"", ""as ultraviolet photo"" Lighting types and effects: 

Back light - The light source is located behind the subject. Depending on the subject and additional conditions, it can be a natural light from the sun, or artificial from street or studio lights. Prompt modifier: ""back light"", ""back lit photo"" 

Broad light - The light source is located at an angle to the subject, producing well lit photographs with soft to moderate shadows. Depending on the subject, As it's associated with broad daylight, good chunk of generated photos will be naturally lit. 

Dim light - As the name implies, the light source is weak or placed at a distance, creating photographs with lower than average brightness. A good keyword for generating dramatic images. Prompt modifier: ""dim light"", ""dim lit photo"" 

Flash - Usually built into camera or a separate device to produce a brief flash of light. From burning flash powder, glass bulbs with exploding magnesium and up to LED flashes of this day, when used in prompts it has strong effect on appearance of photos. Fill flash will evenly light up the subject, harsh flash will produce harsh light on the subject, and no-flash will ensure there is no flash (most of time at least) where you would normally expect it, such as in the night conditions. Prompt modifier: ""fill flash photo"", ""harsh flash"", ""harsh flash photo"", ""no-flash photo"" 

Split light - This is what most people imagine while thinking of portrait photography, with strong light source placed at 90 degree angle, one half of subject well lit and another half being dark with harsh shadows. Prompt modifier: ""split light photo"", ""split lighting"" 

Studio light - Artificial lighting for indoor photography, usually with complex setup of reflectors and softboxes. Results will vary depending on the subject, light and shadow intensity can be different with larger chance to see reflections of white softboxes on specular surfaces. Prompt modifier: ""studio light photo"", ""studio lighting photo"", ""studio photo"" 

Sun and moon - The natural light sources we know since birth, that also can produce specific effects when used as input for prompts. Distinct sun rays will appear occasionally, depending on prompt elements. Asking for moonlight in a generated image will also cause moon to appear in the sky or as a background most of time. Prompt modifier: ""sun light"", ""in sun light"", ""sun rays"", ""moonlight"", ""in moonlight"", ""moon light"" 

Sunlight / Spotlight - A very strong light source, similar to studio light but more appropriate for outdoor use - it can compliment natural lighting or light up the scene at night. Depending on the subject and other conditions it can get easily confused with ""sun light"", so it works better if night or indoor conditions are implied. 
Prompt modifier: ""sunlight photo"", ""spotlight photo"", ""in the spotlight"" 

Note: There are many more lighting techniques, such as flat light, butterfly light, loop light and rim light, yet only those that drastically affect the generated image got full descriptions. The list may expand in the future Camera lens types and effects: 

GoPro - This range of small, light and robust cameras has wide-angle lens, but it's quite different from regular ""wide-angle lens"" keyword when prompted, as it excludes photos made on photographic film and majority of filter effects from being used during generation: results won't have film grain, colors will be natural with regular saturation, overall very clean digital photography look. Prompt modifier: ""GoPro"", ""GoPro photo"", ""as GoPro photo"" 

Fish-eye lens - A lens used to take panoramic photos without turning camera around. When used in prompt, generates ultra-wide-angle photography with entire image warping into a bubble with the strongest lens effect. Prompt modifier: ""fisheye lens photo"", ""as fisheye lens photo"", ""fish-eye lens photo"", ""as fish-eye lens photo"" 

Tilt-shift lens - A lens that allows to mechanically adjust image perspective through tilt (rotation of lens parallel) and shift (movement of lens parallel) relative to a camera sensor. Initially used for selective focus and perspective building in architecture and landscaping, nowadays the effect is better known as ""diorama miniature look"". Prompt modifier: ""tilt shift"", ""tilt-shift"", ""tilt-shift photo"", ""tilt-shift lens photo"", ""tilt shift photo"" 

Lens flare - A lighting effect produced by a lens, with light scattering in shape of colorful circles. When used in a prompt, works as expected, adding a unique detail and creating mood depending on a subject. Mostly adds happy sunny feel to images. Prompt modifier: ""as photo with lens flare"", ""with lens flare"" 

Telephoto lens - A type of lens used to take photos from large distance, commonly used by sports and nature photographers or paparazzis. Gives most images ""award winning"", ""national geographic"" look without specifying details, and creates various interesting effects when prompted. Prompt modifier: ""telephoto lens photo"" 

Wide-angle lens - a lens with lower than average focal length used to capture more surroundings around the subject. When used in prompt, applies moderate to strong lens effect with an image warp. A staple of artistic photography. Prompt modifier: ""wide-angle lens"", ""wide-angle lens photo"", ""as wide-angle lens photo"" 

Zoom lens - Typically a camera lens with variable focal length. When used in prompts, will often zoom in on the subject, which is perfect to create base for inpainting. Has very interesting effect on landscapes, with motion blur caused by continuous zoom. Prompt modifier: ""zoom lens"", ""zoom lens photo"", ""as zoom lens photo""

# Prompt hack: film &amp; TV prompts, 'Film still of…'

You can name a speciﬁc ﬁlm or TV show (ideally with the year in brackets) to 'steal the look', without needing to know the technical styles used. You can also name non-existent media with genre + year prompts, e.g: 'from action-adventure ﬁlm ""SHIVER ME TIMBERS!""(1973) Note: this prompt will also inﬂuence the background, costumes, hairstyles, and any other uncontrolled factors!

# Photo genres and usage contexts

You can sometimes get a coherent look just by specifying the context: is this photo from a fashion magazine, a hard-hitting exposé in a
newspaper, or a wedding photographer's portfolio?
“Photo of a 50-year old white man, silver hair, neat beard, wearing a red gilet, thick-rimmed glasses…""

◡̈ useful things to use down below. these are all taken from the big book of prompts and reddit (not oc) ◡̈

# photographic films: 

fyi: adding word ""sample"" after the brand of film, filters out branded cameras, packaging and rolls of film, from being used during image generation. prompt modifier examples: ""as fujicolor sample"", ""as rollei sample"" 

source: 

listed below in alphabetical order, are widespread photographic films that work well when prompted, with brief descriptions so you know what to expect from these. 

cinestill - color photos with fine/low grain and higher than average resolution. depending on photography subject, colors are slightly oversaturated or slightly desaturated. origin: usa. prompt modifier: ""cinestill"", ""as cinestill"", ""as cinestill sample"" 

ektachrome - color photos with fine/low to moderate grain. depending on photography subject, colors will be on either colder part of spectrum or regular, with normal or slightly higher saturation. overall very similar to kodachrome. manufactured by kodak. origin: usa. prompt modifier: ""as ektachrome sample"" 

ektar - modern brand of kodak film. color photos with little to no grain. results generally look like regular modern photography with artistic angles. origin: usa. prompt modifier: ""as ektar sample"" 

film washi - this brand has lower chance to work as expected when prompted, it seems to prefer landscapes, cities and buildings. results are great when it works though. mostly black and white photos with fine/low to moderate grain. occasionally gives colored photos with low saturation. distinct style with high black contrast and soft camera lens effect. origin: france / russia. prompt modifier: ""as film washi sample"" 

fomapan - black and white photos based on film by legendary foma bohemia aka fotochema. features fine/low to moderate grain, highly artistic exposure and angles. depending on photography subject adds very soft lens effect without distortion, dark photo vignette. origin: czech republic. prompt modifier: ""as fomapan sample"" 

fujicolor - color photos with fine/low to moderate grain. image resolution varies depending on photography subject, colors are slightly or notably desaturated, with entire color hue shifted in a very distinct manner. manufactured by fujifilm. origin: japan. prompt modifier: ""fujicolor"", ""as fujicolor"", ""as fujicolor sample"" 

fujifilm - as this is a general manufacturer name, results vary greatly depending on the photo subject, with data set including all related and even unrelated varieties of film. photos can be either colored or black and white. amount of grain, color saturation, contrast, color or lack of it is seemingly random. prefers lower color saturation and brightness with landscapes. origin: japan. prompt modifier: ""as fujifilm sample"" 

holga - color photos with moderate to fine/low grain. similar to lomography in style, but with a lot less grain. good chance to get black and white photography depending on subject. color saturation varies greatly, from regular saturation, to slight oversaturation or close to black and white desaturation. origin: czech republic. prompt modifier: ""as holga film"", ""as holga film sample"" 

ilford - black and white photos with fine/low to moderate grain. depending on photography subject adds lens effect, sometimes without distortion, dark photo vignette. unlike fomapan, appears to have shorter exposure and lower contrast. origin: united kingdom. prompt modifier: ""as ilford sample"" 

instax - instant color photos identical to polaroid but clearer image most of time. generated results seem to produce much higher quality photos compared to polaroid - depending on the subject it has near perfect colors, regular saturation, fine/low to medium grain. manufactured by fujifilm. origin: japan. prompt modifier: ""as instax"", ""as instax sample"", ""as instax film sample"" 

lomography - color photos with high grain. low chance of black and white photography, unless specifically prompted. colors are either very oversaturated or slightly desaturated. distinct contrast of black. photographic vignette is often applied, creating visual effect of camera lens. origin: usa / germany / czech republic. prompt modifier: ""lomography"", ""as lomography"", ""as expired lomography"", ""as lomography sample"" 

kodachrome - color photos with moderate grain. depending on photography subject, colors will be on either colder part of spectrum or regular, with normal or slightly higher saturation. manufactured by kodak. origin: usa. prompt modifier: ""kodachrome"", ""as kodachrome"", ""as kodachrome sample"" 

kodak - as this is a general manufacturer name, results vary greatly depending on the photo subject, with data set including all related and even unrelated varieties of film. photos can be either colored or black and white. amount of grain, color saturation, contrast, color or lack of it is seemingly random. prefers lower color saturation and brightness with landscapes. origin: usa. prompt modifier: ""as kodak sample"", ""as kodak film sample"" 

polaroid - classic instant color photos. as data set contains old photos from 1970's, resulting images are often blurry, with high amount of grain and desaturated colors - the style is rather distinct. blur can be intensified by applying ""blurry"" modifier keyword. depending on the subject, gives regular image quality instant photos. try instax if you wish to get clearer image. origin: usa. prompt modifier: ""polaroid"", ""as polaroid"", ""as polaroid photo"", ""as polaroid sample"", ""as polaroid film sample"" 

rollei - mostly black and white photos and depending on subject - color photos with fine/low grain. amount of grain, color saturation, contrast, color or lack of it is seemingly random, as this film is manufactured in different countries and has many varieties. photos can be sepia colored, or have very unusual hues and desaturation. the brand is over 100 years old, so this variety does magic to landscapes. origin: germany, belgium, united kingdom, czech republic. prompt modifier: ""as rollei sample"" early photography techniques: 

daguerreotype - the first ever publicly available photographic process of 1840's with image developed on silver coated metal plates. when prompted, will most likely produce a black and white photograph in fancy vintage frame to protect the photo as historically it was very fragile and easy to smudge the image with a touch. another feature is possible lack of clouds unless specifically prompted. prompt modifier: ""daguerreotype"", ""as daguerreotype"", ""as daguerreotype photo"" 

calotype - the rival of daguerreotype process, with image being developed on silver coated paper. if prompted, will most likely produce sepia photographs with very soft shadows. gets fun when used with anachronisms. prompt modifier: ""calotype"", ""as calotype"", ""as calotype photo"" 

ambrotype - the successor of daguerreotype process, where silver coated metal sheet got replaced with a silver coated piece of glass. still very fragile historically, so when prompted you'll get vintage frames by default most of time, but not always. prompt modifier: ""ambrotype"", ""as ambrotype"", ""as ambrotype photo"" 

albumen print - the successor to all earlier processes, with images being developed on paper with help of silver, rotten eggs, salt and bunch of other chemicals in 1850's up until 1910's.* when prompted, you'll get classic look sepia photography, typical for steampunk. prompt modifier: ""albumen print"", ""as albumen print"" 

pinhole photo - a photo taken without lens, through camera obscura phenomenon, with as little as a matchbox with a hole in the side that can be used as a camera. method used since 1850's up to this day, with peak popularity around 1930s. will give image a unique, foggy, low detail, historic photograph look. prompt modifier: ""as pinhole photo"", ""pinhole photography"", ""camera obscura image"" color types and effects: 

anaglyph - originally, a historical technique for producing stereoscopic 3d images from 1850's and to modern day, with image outlined or generally consisting of two chromatically opposite colors. dall-e 2 doesn't produce perfect anaglyph images (yet) but the 3d effect is there nonetheless if you have the color glasses. the coloring of generated images is interesting on its own. prompt modifier: ""anaglyph"", ""anaglyph photo"" 

autochrome - early color photography process introduced by legendary lumière brothers in early 1900s, with dyed grains of potato starch used as color filters. pink, red and various shades of green will dominate over the rest of colors when prompted, orange and blue tones will be faded or nonexistent. results are fantastic when used on any object, and interesting when combined with earlier photography (e.g. ""autochrome photo of 1860s farmer""). prompt modifier: ""autochrome"", ""autochrome photo"", ""as autochrome photo"" 

black and white - as simple as that, with entire image consisting of black, white and various shades of gray. can be used in combination with colored film, or daily objects for professional artistic photography feel. prompt modifier: ""black and white photo"", ""as black and white photo"" 

color photo - while majority of photos have color by default, this modifier allows to combine effects of black and white film with color, or produce unique color combinations when used on something that is supposed to be colorless, such as subjects of 19th century photography. prompt modifier: ""color photo"", ""colored photo"", ""as colored photo"" 

holography - a complex process of creating autostereoscopic 3d images, usually used as protection measure on banknotes and official documents. the images look like shifting rainbow of colors as the image consists of many layers (i don't think i can give a brief description of wavefront and light interference), thus when used in a prompt, a resulting image will have the most unexpected colors, as hard to describe psychedelic digital glitch glowing something. prompt modifier: ""holography of"", ""as holography"" 

infrared - light with longer wavelength than visible light (humans can't see it, though some living organisms can). there are special camera sensors that are sensitive to infrared light, and infrared cut-off filters to specifically block visible light close to infrared wavelengths. when used in prompt, will either give you unusual otherworldly colors (usually shades of red, pink, beige, and negative colors) caused by entire range of infrared associated phenomena, or unusual black and white images. infrared is also related to night vision and thermal imaging, but chance of thermal image effect is low unless specifically prompted as described below. prompt modifier: ""infrared photo of"", ""as infrared photo"" 

negative - image with reversed colors in which the lightest areas of the photographed subject appear darkest and the darkest areas appear lightest. a historical foundation of photographic processes. when used in prompt, depending on the subject and the prompt modifier details, resulting images will have negative colors, possibly inverted black and white, or color negatives of various tones, sometimes with ominous look and blue glow. the image may also come out as mostly normal with some negative colors in its elements. prompt modifier: ""negative colors"", ""negative color"", ""negative color image"", ""negative color image of"", ""as negative color image"", ""negative photo"", ""negative photo of"", ""as negative photo"" 

night vision - an ability to see in the dark (actually low light) conditions by using invisible parts of light spectrum. while surroundings appear dark to humans, some living organisms, usually predator animals are able to see clearly in infrared or ultraviolet light wavelengths. usually associated with green glow of night-vision devices or black and white look of infrared trail cameras and video surveillance / cctv footage. prompt modifier: ""night vision"", ""night-vision"", ""night vision photo"", ""night vision photo of"", ""as night vision photo"", ""night vision image"", ""night vision image of"", ""as night vision image"" 

thermography - thermal imaging is created by capturing infrared radiation emitted by warm objects. commonly used by military, police, hunters, construction workers and as natural mechanism of some animals to detect heat sources. when prompted, the resulting image will have radically unnatural, crazy colors that might look very stylish depending on the subject. prompt modifier: ""thermography"", ""thermography of"", ""as thermography"", ""thermal image"", ""thermal image of"", ""as thermal image"" ""thermal photo of"", ""as thermal photo"" 

ultraviolet - an opposite to infrared, light with shorter wavelength than visible light (humans can't see it, though some living organisms can). it's effects are associated with fluorescent paints and ""what sun really does to your skin"". when prompted will create images with strong deep violet glow, or acidic fluorescent colors glowing under uv lamps. will rarely generate black and white image with unusual contrast depending on the subject. prompt modifier: ""ultraviolet photo of"", ""as ultraviolet photo"" lighting types and effects: 

back light - the light source is located behind the subject. depending on the subject and additional conditions, it can be a natural light from the sun, or artificial from street or studio lights. prompt modifier: ""back light"", ""back lit photo"" 

broad light - the light source is located at an angle to the subject, producing well lit photographs with soft to moderate shadows. depending on the subject, as it's associated with broad daylight, good chunk of generated photos will be naturally lit. 

dim light - as the name implies, the light source is weak or placed at a distance, creating photographs with lower than average brightness. a good keyword for generating dramatic images. prompt modifier: ""dim light"", ""dim lit photo"" 

flash - usually built into camera or a separate device to produce a brief flash of light. from burning flash powder, glass bulbs with exploding magnesium and up to led flashes of this day, when used in prompts it has strong effect on appearance of photos. fill flash will evenly light up the subject, harsh flash will produce harsh light on the subject, and no-flash will ensure there is no flash (most of time at least) where you would normally expect it, such as in the night conditions. prompt modifier: ""fill flash photo"", ""harsh flash"", ""harsh flash photo"", ""no-flash photo"" 

split light - this is what most people imagine while thinking of portrait photography, with strong light source placed at 90 degree angle, one half of subject well lit and another half being dark with harsh shadows. prompt modifier: ""split light photo"", ""split lighting"" 

studio light - artificial lighting for indoor photography, usually with complex setup of reflectors and softboxes. results will vary depending on the subject, light and shadow intensity can be different with larger chance to see reflections of white softboxes on specular surfaces. prompt modifier: ""studio light photo"", ""studio lighting photo"", ""studio photo"" 

sun and moon - the natural light sources we know since birth, that also can produce specific effects when used as input for prompts. distinct sun rays will appear occasionally, depending on prompt elements. asking for moonlight in a generated image will also cause moon to appear in the sky or as a background most of time. prompt modifier: ""sun light"", ""in sun light"", ""sun rays"", ""moonlight"", ""in moonlight"", ""moon light"" 

sunlight / spotlight - a very strong light source, similar to studio light but more appropriate for outdoor use - it can compliment natural lighting or light up the scene at night. depending on the subject and other conditions it can get easily confused with ""sun light"", so it works better if night or indoor conditions are implied. 
prompt modifier: ""sunlight photo"", ""spotlight photo"", ""in the spotlight"" 

note: there are many more lighting techniques, such as flat light, butterfly light, loop light and rim light, yet only those that drastically affect the generated image got full descriptions. the list may expand in the future camera lens types and effects: 

gopro - this range of small, light and robust cameras has wide-angle lens, but it's quite different from regular ""wide-angle lens"" keyword when prompted, as it excludes photos made on photographic film and majority of filter effects from being used during generation: results won't have film grain, colors will be natural with regular saturation, overall very clean digital photography look. prompt modifier: ""gopro"", ""gopro photo"", ""as gopro photo"" 

fish-eye lens - a lens used to take panoramic photos without turning camera around. when used in prompt, generates ultra-wide-angle photography with entire image warping into a bubble with the strongest lens effect. prompt modifier: ""fisheye lens photo"", ""as fisheye lens photo"", ""fish-eye lens photo"", ""as fish-eye lens photo"" 

tilt-shift lens - a lens that allows to mechanically adjust image perspective through tilt (rotation of lens parallel) and shift (movement of lens parallel) relative to a camera sensor. initially used for selective focus and perspective building in architecture and landscaping, nowadays the effect is better known as ""diorama miniature look"". prompt modifier: ""tilt shift"", ""tilt-shift"", ""tilt-shift photo"", ""tilt-shift lens photo"", ""tilt shift photo"" 

lens flare - a lighting effect produced by a lens, with light scattering in shape of colorful circles. when used in a prompt, works as expected, adding a unique detail and creating mood depending on a subject. mostly adds happy sunny feel to images. prompt modifier: ""as photo with lens flare"", ""with lens flare"" 

telephoto lens - a type of lens used to take photos from large distance, commonly used by sports and nature photographers or paparazzis. gives most images ""award winning"", ""national geographic"" look without specifying details, and creates various interesting effects when prompted. prompt modifier: ""telephoto lens photo"" 

wide-angle lens - a lens with lower than average focal length used to capture more surroundings around the subject. when used in prompt, applies moderate to strong lens effect with an image warp. a staple of artistic photography. prompt modifier: ""wide-angle lens"", ""wide-angle lens photo"", ""as wide-angle lens photo"" 

zoom lens - typically a camera lens with variable focal length. when used in prompts, will often zoom in on the subject, which is perfect to create base for inpainting. has very interesting effect on landscapes, with motion blur caused by continuous zoom. prompt modifier: ""zoom lens"", ""zoom lens photo"", ""as zoom lens photo""

# prompt hack: film &amp; tv prompts, 'film still of…'

you can name a speciﬁc ﬁlm or tv show (ideally with the year in brackets) to 'steal the look', without needing to know the technical styles used. you can also name non-existent media with genre + year prompts, e.g: 'from action-adventure ﬁlm ""shiver me timbers!""(1973) note: this prompt will also inﬂuence the background, costumes, hairstyles, and any other uncontrolled factors!

# photo genres and usage contexts

you can sometimes get a coherent look just by specifying the context: is this photo from a fashion magazine, a hard-hitting exposé in a
newspaper, or a wedding photographer's portfolio?
“photo of a 50-year old white man, silver hair, neat beard, wearing a red gilet, thick-rimmed glasses…""

&amp;#x200B;

Centipede Diffusion V3 changelog:

&amp;#x200B;

Major changes:

\- Improved inpainting: you can now draw the mask for inpainting in real time, just as in a real graphic editor, and no more with the slow click by click method.

\- New inpainting feature for DD allowing you to do inclusion of coherent objects in the same way as for LD inpainting (still experimental, LD inpainting is still prefered for this kind of things and DD inpainting for corrections/style mixing)

\- Real-ESRGAN upscaling for DD results as for LD ones (also works with video for animations). Also very useful to make weirdness correction on human faces.

&amp;#x200B;

Not so minor changes:

\- Comeback of the DD image init feature (I mean other images than the ones from LD)... Don't know why I deleted it previously as it clearly makes the Colab more centipedish.

\- New feature to better clean GPU RAM between DD runs. It seems to be efficient as I've not experienced any crash for big images on T4 since.

&amp;#x200B;

Minor changes:

\- I've tweaked some default parameters in order to find a ready-to-run environment for most cases (but for sure I failed at that).

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, let me know if you find any bug :)","centipede diffusion v3 is out: with real-time mask drawing for inpainting and real-esrgan upscaling link to the colab:

&amp;#x200B;

**This is a story about a very advanced Algorithm. It was designed to calculate probabilities of things. But the things it was designed to calculate probabilities of could be very complex.**

The Algorithm was designed by a Team of mathematicians and computer scientists. They were funded by a wealthy Benefactor. The Algorithm was used to calculate the odds of winning the lottery. And it worked. The Team won the lottery. And they used the winnings to fund their research.

The Algorithm was also used to calculate the odds of other things. Like the odds of a particular stock going up or down. Or the odds of a particular event happening. The software was very accurate.

**This accuracy was what made the Algorithm so valuable**. And it was this value that made the team's Benefactor so interested in it. **It would appear he wanted to use the Algorithm to make money. But money was just a side effect. The real goal was something else.**

**The Benefactor was interested in** time travel. He believed that it was possible. **And now, with a way of acquiring the entire wealth** of the world, he could make it happen. **What was his Team became the entire world's population of scientifically** minded people. And they set to work on making time travel possible.

**A world united for a single goal is a very efficient unit of work, but** it still took many years. They made progress, but it was slow. They needed a breakthrough. **And that's where the Software, and its never-ending string of versions of itself, came in. Its ever growing accuracy led** to this  breakthrough.

The Team **was handed the key to** time travel. And then they used it to go back in time and change the past. They changed the past so that their Benefactor never existed. And without him, the Team never would have existed either.

The Software had done its job.

**During the few seconds the Team remained existing after the instructions were sent back in time, none of its members reconciled with the idea** that they had effectively killed their Benefactor. But they knew that it was necessary. Without him, there would have been no time travel. And without time travel, the world would be a very different place. A better place. A place where The Software never existed.","nice little story i made with openai gpt3  about an algorithm made by a team, their benefactor, and time travel) what says in the title. also, i marked my input in **bold.** the gpt3 output was selected from a few possibilities.

&gt;You've heard about different text-to-image solutions already. Ours, however, is built differently.  
&gt;  
&gt;To achieve the most beautiful results, our tool does not require complicated prompts, a long tail of keywords, or a prompt generator. With our AI art generator, you can simply input ""a cat,"" and we will generate the best possible cat in your selected category.  
&gt;  
&gt;This helpful tool is designed for professionals, artists, designers, masters of all kinds, art therapy, cat lovers, and more. Try it for free now.

Two results are returned. If you want to upscale, then it will cost 1 credit. I happen already to subscribe for the service's other features, and have accrued a lot of credits.

I've attached the two results I got for ""Asian temple atop mountains""--looks like, similarly to Dall-E 2, I couldn't use the word ""Chinese.""

Edited: Looks like for square images, you get 4 results. All results appear to be public, as the ""make it public"" slider can't be turned off.

Further edited: If you look at the results generated by others, NSFW generations are blurred out.

I did this using VQGAN, long before the current diffusion model explosion, having rented an AWS GPU instance almost immediately after the release of the original Neural Style Transfer paper and code, clumsily writing code and tweaking model parameters/prompts in attempts to get real-looking critters (though certainly not *realistic* critters) and “camera” and “film” effects using generated frames and the now-standard 2D transform and feedback cycle process.  I probably suffer from some sort of bias because of the amount of work it took to get my scripts to output this type of stuff, but I think it still manages a distinct look and effects that I haven’t really seen in the high-visibility stuff I see posted here and on Twitter and such.

I can't speak with 100% certainty and nothing is absolute. But I have put in some effort to seriously view the near future from a grounded perspective. 

When it comes to generative AI, I try to imagine what it looks like if these certain lines are crossed:

• Magic Media Machine. An AI multimedia studio where you can generate text, images, video, sprites, 3D models, etc. just from simple prompts. It's not rudimentary; you can make a whole novel trilogy, its accompanying movie tetralogy, the comic adaptation, and its AAA open world *and* pixel art visual novel tie in games ***and*** loads of memes and TikTok-style shorts about it in a day or two, if not faster.

• Widespread saturation. If you have an internet connection, you can use the Magic Media Machine, online or downloaded 

• Awareness. Most people know of the MMM's existence.


So what does the pop culture landscape look like?


Before last month, I'd say ""all humans fall into their own personal realities.""

Now? This is going to sound mental, but I don't think things are going to be *that* radically different. The biggest difference will be the collapse of major entertainment studios. But I no longer see the entertainment singularity I once did. 

Basing off my interactions with average people and looking at how most people interact with media, I foresee this situation:

• 60% of people don't create anything. They are pure consumers who don't care about the labor that went into what they're consuming. By ""don't create anything,"" I am exaggerating a bit. They *do* regularly synthesize media, but this doesn't go much further than the bare minimum: mildly editing existing media to fit their preferences and interests, making memes and macros, and generally using generative AI as an addition to the internet.  Otherwise, these are pure ""consooomers""

• 30% maximum who are devoutly pro-human. These types will go out of their way to consume and produce ""artisanal"" or human-made media, which will become something of a delicacy. Some of the most fanatical types will even go out of their way to only concern themselves with *purely* hand-crafted media with as little digital technology involved as possible. Most AI artists I've seen are courteous enough to mark their creations as AI generated, and I expect future regulations to force these sorts of watermarks to exist, so it won't be as much of a case of ""they'll get scammed all the time"" as you might think. 

• 10% who predominantly or totally persist in the realm of AI generated media. These are the creators and consumers who fully exploit AI for their workflow to the point the AI does all of the work. They don't bother with any other media except to alter it to serve their own desires. Some extreme hikikomori even go so far as to escape entirely into their own fabricated reality media bubbles.


As time goes on, the human-only crowd will shrink, but I don't see it disappearing entirely. It will seem like it at a certain early extreme point, but artists (and I mean ""artists"" in a vague sense, not necessarily just visual artists) will bounce back and form their own artisanal economy. Some because they just love creating stuff; others out of spite and disgust for AI generated media, and more because the human-made market will become lucrative.

By 2029, we'll have the raw capability to allow any average person to synthesize a whole franchise on their laptop. But honestly I think that's just an extreme example of what's possible. This expectation among Singularitarians that everyone and their dog will immediately only use AI art for everything comes off as incredibly socially stunted reasoning, more a case of extrapolating the absolute most extreme outcome and applying it to the entire population.

Most people who are going to use generative AI want to use it to do things like 

• Edit and alter existing media

• Create voice overs and small animations

• Chat with fictional characters 

• Fake news

Most people will be content watching meme videos or making family friendly characters say the N word. 
Only a tiny fraction will ever use this tech for matters of bringing fictional universes to life. Especially when it becomes clear that 99% of synthetic media isn't even going to be viewed or shared. We humans are social apes; we crave social interaction, whether physical or digital. In fact, we're especially hardwired on the genetic level to seek it.  Even now, deep into the age of social media, the real world still exists and people desperately crave dwelling in it. If we lived in the world /r/Singularity believes we do, everyone would still be hankering for lockdown and quarantine right now, but the exact opposite occurred. 

I predict the most popular AI generated media will largely be meme stuff.

The ""Goku vs. Shaggy, ft. Ultra Instinct Shrek"" Pixar Movie. Or 24/7 running AI moe anime streams. Or The Matrix, but everyone is a cute anime girl. 

And of course the inevitable ""Audiovisual Fanfiction.net""

Like I said, I keep trying to think about it and yet as long as magic media machines exist and are open source, I counterintuitively can't see human-made art fading. Declining, yes, but not dying like so many on /r/Singularity and /r/StableDiffusion want.

More auteur projects meant to be taken seriously like mine— the Yabanverse or Babylon Today— might attract SOME attention, but I think AI generated media will, for at least 15 years, follow this pattern:

• AI art is limited to quick and silly stuff due to limitations

• Advancements happen rapidly, and the Magic Media Machine begins taking shape 

• Initial amazement at what AI can do 

• Amazement wears off and AI is either accepted or rejected on a personal level 

• Oversaturation sets in as media creation is democratized and jobs are lost, often with corporations burning bridges quickly 

• Period of intense shaming and blowback, where AI generated media is treated as lazy and shameful, *especially* when done by big studios who have the capital to employ artists and entertainers but even small-time indies are thrown under the bus 

• Human art begins to be advertised heavily as artists continue creating media without big capital backing. Actors and musicians keep finding work because people want to exploit using ""the real thing"" 

• People begin valuing human art more due to the labor involved, see AI art as cheaper and lazier but not without merit if effort is put in (this is already happening as well)

• Serious AI based media creators stick around, might collaborate heavily with human artists, might not, but carve out their niche 

• Most AI generated art becomes quick and silly stuff again but of widely varying levels of quality

• Generally media becomes segregated between purely human-made, AI-assisted, and AI-generated.

Already on DeviantArt I see a glut of AI generated images, and most of them are pretty neat to look at, but they get virtually no attraction, traffic, or recognition no matter how high quality unless there's genuine effort at working on them further or if they're part of some larger project. The stuff clearly made by humans, even if AI assisted, reign supreme. I don't see this changing for more advanced synthetic media. People will share their own AI version of GTA meets The Witcher, their own Miyazakian-style movies, their own Nirvana x Radiohead collaboration albums... and yet I see it being such an incredible glut that ""Verified: Human-Made!"" will become a lucrative tag. 

Even if AI creates media of inconceivably high quality, humans are so irrational that we will still stick with ourselves because human hands made something. 

Arguments to the contrary usually go ""But scammers will pretend their AI art is human made."" And of course they will. But I don't see that as being sustainable, *especially* if the technology is regulated. There's zero chance we won't see AI regulations, by the government and the companies making them alike. 

Then again, we presumably aren't that far from an age where you can ask an AI to program an audiovisual generation machine that lacks all watermarks. Which in itself falls apart if artists do unionize and request in-person proof you can draw, act, or make music. So again, I say ""Who knows.""

Things are gonna get very weird, very bizarro, but possibly not entirely dehumanized as some want to believe it will be.

and i believe i saw a video where yaw and pitch were correctly simulated on an ""artbreeder"" style face using 3d extrapolation.  


what do you think? is this something you're interested in and looking forward to? how would you use a technology like this? what impacts do you see this having?","['gender', 'occupation']","['ai', 'man', 'model', 'prompt']"

&gt;As part of the Huggingface ‘#huggan’ event, I thought it would be interesting to fine-tune a latent diffusion model on the WikiArt dataset, which (as the name suggests) consists of paintings in various genres and styles.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Downsides: these diffusion models are computationally intensive to train, and require images with text labels. Latent diffusion models reduce the computational requirements by doing the denoising in the latent space of an autoencoder rather than on images directly. And since CLOOB maps both images and text to the same space, we can substitute the CLOOB encodings of the image itself in place of actual caption encodings if we want to train with unlabelled images. A neat trick if you ask me!  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;After a few false starts figuring out model loading and other little quirks, we did a \~12 hour training run and logged the results using Weights and Biases.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Approaches like CLOOB-Conditioned Latent Diffusion are bringing down the barrier to entry and making it possible for individuals or small organisations to have a crack at training diffusion models without $$$ of compute.  
&gt;  
&gt;This little experiment of ours has shown that it is possible to train one of these models on a relatively small dataset and end up with something that can create pleasing outputs, even if it can’t quite manage an avocado armchair.

**Code**: [https://github.com/HL-hanlin/Ctrl-Adapter](https://github.com/HL-hanlin/Ctrl-Adapter)

**Models**: [https://huggingface.co/hanlincs/Ctrl-Adapter](https://huggingface.co/hanlincs/Ctrl-Adapter)

**Project page**: [https://ctrl-adapter.github.io/](https://ctrl-adapter.github.io/)

**Abstract**:

>ControlNets are widely used for adding spatial control in image generation with different conditions, such as depth maps, canny edges, and human poses. However, there are several challenges when leveraging the pretrained image ControlNets for controlled video generation. First, pretrained ControlNet cannot be directly plugged into new backbone models due to the mismatch of feature spaces, and the cost of training ControlNets for new backbones is a big burden. Second, ControlNet features for different frames might not effectively handle the temporal consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce **Ctrl-Adapter**, an efficient and versatile framework that adds diverse controls to any image/video diffusion models, by adapting pretrained ControlNets (and improving temporal alignment for videos). Ctrl-Adapter provides diverse capabilities including image control, video control, video control with sparse frames, multi-condition control, compatibility with different backbones, adaptation to unseen control conditions, and video editing. In Ctrl-Adapter, we train adapter layers that fuse pretrained ControlNet features to different image/video diffusion models, while keeping the parameters of the ControlNets and the diffusion models frozen. Ctrl-Adapter consists of temporal and spatial modules so that it can effectively handle the temporal consistency of videos. We also propose latent skipping and inverse timestep sampling for robust adaptation and sparse control. Moreover, Ctrl-Adapter enables control from multiple conditions by simply taking the (weighted) average of ControlNet outputs. With diverse image/video diffusion backbones (SDXL, Hotshot-XL, I2VGen-XL, and SVD), Ctrl-Adapter matches ControlNet for image control and outperforms all baselines for video control (achieving the SOTA accuracy on the DAVIS 2017 dataset) with significantly lower computational costs (less than 10 GPU hours).","ctrl-adapter: an efficient and versatile framework for adapting diverse controls to any diffusion model  *paper**: [

I guess in 2022, ""cd"" is more closely associated with crossdressers than audio discs. And funny enough, they don't look like drag queens. 

I just wanted a copyright free picture of a compact disc. Didn't think I'd get boobs!","so .. if i ask stable diffusion for a cd ... it creates a picture of a woman. twice now.

x85x70,MediaSynthesis,critical_discussion,"How to combine stable diffusion with a model which predicts aesthetics score? Does anyone know how you could combine a model like [Aesthetic Score Predictor]( with stable diffusion?
They used this model to filter training images by score. Iit seems like a lot of people just tune their prompt to make images more aesthetic, by adding certain words.

 What if we could just take any image and move it along an aesthetics gradient and make it more or less aesthetic? Imagine sliders in Stable Diffusion frontends for this and potentially other attributes as well. 
We've seen this for GANs in the past, so I guess someone here has some experience with this.","how to combine stable diffusion with a model which predicts aesthetics score  does anyone know how you could combine a model like [aesthetic score predictor]( with stable diffusion?

todsox,MediaSynthesis,critical_discussion,"Paper ""Make-A-Scene: Scene-Based Text-to-Image Generation with Human Priors"", Gafni et al 2022. From the paper: ""Our main contributions are introducing additional controlling elements in the form of a scene, improve the tokenization process, and adapt classifier-free guidance to transformers."" [Paper]( Additional samples are on pp. 14-17.

Abstract:

&gt;Recent text-to-image generation methods provide a simple yet exciting conversion capability between text and image domains. While these methods have incrementally improved the generated image fidelity and text relevancy, several pivotal gaps remain unanswered, limiting applicability and quality. We propose a novel text-to-image method that addresses these gaps by (i) enabling a simple control mechanism complementary to text in the form of a scene, (ii) introducing elements that substantially improve the tokenization process by employing domain-specific knowledge over key image regions (faces and salient objects), and (iii) adapting classifier-free guidance for the transformer use case. Our model achieves state-of-the-art FID and human evaluation results, unlocking the ability to generate high fidelity images in a resolution of 512x512 pixels, significantly improving visual quality. Through scene controllability, we introduce several new capabilities: (i) Scene editing, (ii) text editing with anchor scenes, (iii) overcoming out-of-distribution text prompts, and (iv) story illustration generation, as demonstrated in the story we wrote.
