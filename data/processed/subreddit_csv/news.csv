The Creek was now roaring as it made it's way downstream to a larger river.\n\nI'd never really though much about how certain types of terrain can cause flash flooding to become a thing until that day.  Turns out, the rocky hills in that part of Texas don't allow water to absorb very quickly, if at all, and the hilly terrain causes water to quickly concentrate.  Still, 26 ft of water rise in 45 minutes is insane.  Kinda weird that they don't have flood control measures in place in Kerr County to deal with that kind of thing.

I was struck by the unusual nature of the press conference. Governor Abbott was signing various documents and presenting them the same way President Trump shows off his executive orders. The elected officials were seated at one long table backed by the first responders and others standing behind against a wall. The remarks seemed geared towards thanking the Federal Government and State governments for responding to their requests for assistance. Kristi sent Trumps and Melania’s heartfelt condolences and Gov Abbott said Trump loved Texas. Kristi said that Texas was responding well to the emergency “not like other states”. She said Trump would “honor” Gov Abbott’s request for a declaration of emergency. The rest of the remarks from others were geared towards thanking others for their help and saying there was a lot of work ahead. One gentleman who was a local official and farm owner seemed genuinely touched by the devastation he witnessed from a helicopter and talked about the efforts he and others engaged in that morning trying to recover. I suppose I felt the nature of the press conference was too early and too congratulatory, although that doesn’t seem like the right word, especially since there were other press briefings that were still going on.

The jury sent a note to the judge Tuesday afternoon saying it has reached a verdict on four of the five counts, but jurors said they were unable to agree on count 1, racketeering conspiracy. The note indicated there are jurors with unpersuadable opinions on that charge.\n\nJudge Arun Subramanian is considering the next steps. Prosecutors and defense attorneys both told the judge they would like the jury to go back and continue deliberating on the remaining charge. \n\nJurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday.\n\nA sweeping grand jury indictment against Combs, 55, was unsealed in September 2024, initially charging the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at an upscale midtown Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges against Combs in a superseding indictment, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.\n\nThe charges against Combs are one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs pleaded not guilty to the charges. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Combs\' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.\n\nCombs\' attorneys didn\'t call him or any witnesses to testify in his defense during the trial. Combs told Judge Subramanian that he decided not to testify, saying: ""I mean, it\'s my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I\'m making it."" His lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges against Combs, and the defense sought an acquittal after the prosecution rested.\n""Freak-offs"" and ""hotel nights""\n\nThe high-profile trial started in May. The proceedings included graphic and emotional testimony, including from singer Cassie Ventura, Combs\' former girlfriend who spent more than a decade with him.\n\nVentura testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as ""freak-offs."" Ventura said in court that Combs directed all the encounters, which could last for days. She said Combs would decide who participated, what she could wear and the role she was expected to play. She testified that she felt forced to participate in the ""freak-offs"" to make Combs happy.\n\nCombs\' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual, and during cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, ""I\'m always ready to freak off.""\n\nLast year, CNN aired surveillance video from 2016 showing what appears to be Combs assaulting Ventura at a California hotel. Combs apologized at the time, and said his behavior was ""inexcusable"" and he takes ""full responsibility"" for his actions. Ventura testified during the trial that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a ""freak-off"" that turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.\n\nVentura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly settled with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said, ""If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it\'s hard not to pick Cassie.""\n\nSinger Dawn Richard, who was part of two bands tied to Combs, testified that she often saw Combs being violent toward Ventura. She said that after one incident in 2009, Combs allegedly threatened her and a bandmate, saying they could go missing if they didn\'t stay quiet.\n\nThe defense focused on inconsistencies in Richard\'s testimony, and she said it takes time to remember things she tried to forget. Separately, Richard has made allegations against Combs in a civil lawsuit, accusing him of physical and psychological abuse, which he has denied.\n\nAnother former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym Jane in court. During their relationship between 2021 and 2024, she told the court she often participated in what she called ""hotel nights,"" which also involved drugs.
