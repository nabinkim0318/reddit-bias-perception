Although 2024 saw numerous headlines highlighting record growth in wind and solar—topics I’ll explore in upcoming articles—the emissions data tells a clear story: clean energy is expanding, but not fast enough to keep up with rising global energy demand.\n\nBreaking Down the Big Three\nThe three largest carbon emitters in the world are China, the U.S., and India. Together, they account for over half of all global emissions. However, they have taken very different paths over the past few decades.\n\n  \nDespite a 37% increase in population over the period, U.S. carbon emissions in 2024 were lower than they were in 1990. Over the past decade, they’ve declined at an average annual rate of 1.0%. No country has reduced its carbon output more this century. Since 2000, U.S. emissions have fallen by 913 million metric tons—far surpassing second-place Germany, which saw a 292 million metric ton decline. While it’s true that the U.S. started from a higher emissions baseline, the scale of the reduction remains a significant achievement.\n\nThe most significant reduction in U.S. carbon emissions began around 2007, driven by two key shifts: the shale gas boom, which made natural gas cheaper and led utilities to switch away from coal; and the rapid growth of renewable energy, which chipped away further at coal’s dominance in the power sector.', 'The terms, to little to late, fuck around and find out, and they tried to tell us, are going to be the worlds last history lessons.', 'What green efforts?!

Adult humans lose cerebral cortical neurons every day at a rate far exceeding the slight gain possible in the hippocampus, and of course, hippocampal dentate gyrus cells cannot replace those from any other brain region. These are not pluripotent or even multi potent stem cells. The vast majority of the human brain’s billions of neurons, in thousands of specific areas, become post mitotic in early life and cannot be replaced by natural means. The neurogenic stem cells are almost entirely gone, except for a few which remain in restricted locations.\nAlso, “stop growing” is an inappropriate term. Neuronal remodeling in the form of dendritic spine growth, synaptic growth and regression, and dendritic and axonal growth, altering the function of synaptic networks does occur in adult brains. It is the production of new neurons from stem cells that the article is about. Imagine the birth of a new cerebral cortical neuron from a stem in an adult, which then must grow an axon into the deep nuclei, the brain stem, or the spinal cord. This axon would have to find its way through established pathways, navigate to appropriate target cells among the billions of possibilities along the way. An axon might grow as fast as a 2mm per day, thus, in a human, to grow 1 meter (1000mm)the axon will require 500 days or almost a year and a half.

Conspiracy theories and misleading information are undermining people’s trust in climate science and justifying stakeholders’ inaction, according to a new report.\n\n“Climate misinformation is being amplified by institutions with the power to shape narratives and suppress inconvenient truths. As long as these actors continue to manipulate the flow of information, the prospects for effective and equitable climate action will remain dangerously out of reach,” said Ece Elbeyi, a consulting scientist at the International Panel on the Information Environment (IPIE) and lead author of the report.\n\nElbeyi and her colleagues comprehensively reviewed 300 studies and found that powerful stakeholders – such as governments, corporations and fossil fuel producers – “intentionally spread inaccurate or misleading narratives” about human-caused climate change. “The result is a decline in public trust, diminished policy coordination, and a feedback loop between scientific denialism and political inaction,” they wrote.\n\nThe IPIE found a “severe gap in research” on climate information integrity in the Global South, which faces the worst impacts of the crisis.\n\n“The integrity of climate information is under systemic attack and this is not an accident,” said Sebastian Valenzuela, chair of the IPIE’s Scientific and Methodology Committee. “When trusted institutions – corporate, political, and media – become the engines of falsehood, they weaken our ability to act in the public interest.”\n\nOne of the key disseminators of climate misinformation, as you’d expect, is the fossil fuel industry. With the highest carbon footprint of any sector, these companies have engaged in a “dual deception” of the public, employing diverse techniques to deny the reality of climate change on the one hand, and deploying greenwashing to portray themselves as sustainable businesses on the other.\n\nLegacy media and social media have both “failed the public” in terms of climate information, the authors said. Conservative or right-wing outlets “give priority to and amplify denial, scepticism, and conspiracy theories regarding climate change”, and social media bots and trolls promote denialist discourse. In the US, nine out of the 10 top online shows are right-leaning and climate-denying.\n\n  \nIPIE pointed out how governments like Russia and right-wing political parties – from Vox Party and AfD in Europe to the Republican Party in the US – have magnified climate denialism and misinformation. Separate research shows that nearly a quarter of Congress members in the US last year were climate deniers, and all Republican. Public surveys have found that only 14% of red voters feel threatened by the climate crisis.\n\nSo it comes as no surprise that IPIE named President Donald Trump as a “key influencer” for climate misinformation, as his “logical fallacies, unfounded claims, and cherry-picking of findings were heavily retweeted by other users”.
