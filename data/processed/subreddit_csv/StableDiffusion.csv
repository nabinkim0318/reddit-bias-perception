1lso67i,StableDiffusion,These are some of my achievements in exploring virtual reality. I really like these environments and characters that do not actually exist. I hope to hear criticism and suggestions so I can continue to improve,"    Being barefoot is not because I'm a pervert, but because I want to observe the stability of flux-generated feet



    Although I can't share WF directly (but I have shared it with friends who have helped me, I just am not ready to make it public yet, so please don't blame me :-) )
    But I am willing to share every detail:
    1. Using flux-dev/chroma + amater V6 lora as the base, chroma is somewhat unstable, but occasionally it can produce amazing results
    2. Generated with 2pass, no inpaint
    3. 99% of the effect comes from RES4LYF nodes (https://github.com/ClownsharkBatwing/RES4LYF)

But can a video model trained for only anime output do more on local machines than something like veo3 or Wan2.1? My thought was if its trained on anime/cartoons and no (or minimal for whats needed) realistic data, wouldn't it fit more due to anime styles being generally simpler than real images? Or does it still use the same number of parameters despite things being simpler in the training data?

I ask because I am REALLY hoping we get some anime video models at some point and thats what they specialize in rather than them all trying for super impressive realistic outputs (which are still cool). Like an Illustrious t2v or something.

I mean how much further could we get with 32gb VRAM if we just did cartoons or anime? Would love to see what the community content would look like for this if it let creators output more with less hardware.

Take it a step further and what if the models were broken down by style choice rather than shoving them all into 1 mega model? What sort of benefits might that have if any?

1lse6g1,StableDiffusion,How Well Are AI Model Creators Keeping Up With Aesthetic Terminology and Visual Vocabulary?,"I've been thinking about something that's been bugging me about AI image generation, and I'm curious what others think.

**The Core Issue: AI Models Need a Shared Visual Language**

Every AI model relies on what's essentially a lingua franca a shared vocabulary that connects concepts to generate what we're asking for. When we prompt these models, we're constantly trying to figure out which combination of words will unlock the specific aesthetic or visual element we want. But here's the thing: how current and comprehensive is that vocabulary?

**New Aesthetics Are Constantly Emerging**

Today I learned about ""Angelpunk"" a term describing the early 90s fascination with Judeo-Christian iconography in art and media (think Evangelion, Trigun). This got me wondering: are model creators actively updating their training data to include emerging aesthetic movements and terminology?

I stumbled across an entire aesthetics wiki that's basically a rabbit hole of visual categories I never knew existed. Did you know there's a distinction between ""techware"" and ""warware""? Both have similar vibes but completely different visual signatures. Same with synthwave, vaporwave, and outrun they all use synthetic music aesthetics but are distinctly different movements.

**The Specificity Problem**

Here's where it gets interesting: we often lack precise language for specific visual elements. Take superhero masks as an example. Most people default to ""superhero mask"" and get a domino mask, but there are actually several distinct types:
- Domino masks (classic Batman/Robin style)
- Bridge-up masks (covering from nose bridge upward)
- Hair-out variants (full coverage but hair exposed)
- Reverse masks (Winter Soldier style, covering nose down)

**The Real Question**

How well are these nuanced aesthetic categories and precise visual descriptors actually built into current AI models? Are we limited by:
1. Training data that doesn't include emerging aesthetic movements?
2. Lack of precise terminology for specific visual elements?
3. Model creators not keeping pace with evolving visual culture?

When I try to generate something specific, I often feel like I'm playing a guessing game with the model's vocabulary. Sometimes it nails exactly what I want; other times it seems like certain aesthetic concepts just don't exist in its training.

**Discussion Points:**
- Have you noticed gaps in AI models' understanding of specific aesthetics?
- Are there visual styles or elements you can't seem to get models to understand?
- How do you think model creators should approach updating aesthetic vocabulary?

I'm genuinely curious whether this is a training data issue, a terminology gap, or if I'm just not finding the right prompt combinations. What's your experience been?

1lsd52s,StableDiffusion,Some question about LoRA training,"Hello everyone!

I want to train a LoRA for Flux inspired by classic sword and sorcery imagery from the 1980s. Think of Larry Elmore, Keith Parkinson, Jeff Easley, Clyde Caldwell, Frank Frazetta, or Boris Vallejo, for example. I don't want the LoRA to perfectly replicate each of these styles, but rather to create a new one that works well as an amalgamation of all of them.



Well, I have three questions.

First, I would like the LoRA to recognize certain elements and learn to replicate them perfectly:

\- The character's class or stereotype: barbarian, warrior, sorcereress, wizard, thief, cleric, paladin, ranger, etc.

\- The character's race: human, elf, drow, dwarf, halfling, etc.

\- Classic creatures and monsters: orcs, goblins, skeleton warriors, vampires, dragons, beholders, mind flayers, centaurs, griffins, phoenixes, etc.

\- Specific poses: arms akimbo, arms crossed, kneeling with a weapon held, standing over corpses or ruins with a raised sword and chest expanded, etc.

\- Female breasts: I don't want to make a pornographic LoRA, but I do think it's important that it knows how to draw topless women in an anatomically correct way.

So, my first question is this: how many images of each type (dwarves, orcs, breasts, etc.) do I need to give the LoRA for it to learn how to replicate them, and from how many different angles?



Secondly, since the faces of the characters in these types of images tend to be quite neutral, to give the user more control in the future when choosing the type of faces they want, I've come up with the idea of ​​generating multiple images of facial expressions (anger, fear, sadness, surprise, etc.) using the Arthemy Comix Flux base model + Larry Elmore's LoRA + a LoRA of facial expressions. So, my question is: is it acceptable to use these AI-generated images as part of the LoRA training data? Will it cause me problems?



Thirdly, I want to know if I'm correctly describing the images for the LoRA training.

1lscbye,StableDiffusion,Character consistency for cartoon styles,"Anybody know where I can read more about generating better prompts for consistent characters? I know about using Loras etc. but I just want to get started with simple stickfigure characters.

For example, I tried using these prompts:


>In a minimalist cartoon illustration featuring a flat pastel-yellow background (#F7E36B), the scene is set in a 16:9 landscape aspect ratio, maintaining a vivid, playful aesthetic. The foreground showcases a stick figure with an oversized round white head, a thick black outline (\~8px), dot eyes, expressive eyebrows, and a comically surprised mouth. The character has thin, exaggerated stick arms and legs, with mitten-like hands and flat feet, wearing only plain white shorts. The expression suggests a realization or shock, contributing to the theme of self-sabotage.

>In the middle ground, another stick figure, similarly designed, strikes a pondering pose, featuring one hand on their head and the other hand outstretched as if questioning. Both figures maintain a playful interaction while adhering to the cartoon's bold, expressive visual style.

>In the background, a simplistic setting of a single, thick-outlined black table with a minimal white vase on it adds context without clutter. The environment features essential elements only, each with super-thick black outlines and solid white interiors, ensuring a clean, humorous visual narrative.

>A speech bubble (with a thick black outline) emerges from the first character's mouth, capturing the sentence, ""Did you know you're probably sabotaging your own happiness right now and don’t even realize it?"" in a playful, hand-drawn font. The text inside the bubble is pure black, enhancing readability and fitting seamlessly into the cartoon world.

>The composition leaves a clean, 5% margin around the edges, maintaining focus and clarity, ensuring that all visual elements and messages are easily recognizable at a glance. This image instantly conveys the theme of subconscious actions affecting one's well-being in a humorous, relatable manner.

>In the foreground, a cartoon stick figure with two arms and two legs sits at the edge of a white bed, its oversized bald white head hung low, reflecting a sense of melancholy. The figure's expressive brows are furrowed and mouth slightly downturned, amplifying the feeling of dissatisfaction. Beside it, a simple white alarm clock rings loudly, indicating the start of another monotonous day.

>In the middle ground, an ascending staircase fades into an indistinct hallway, symbolizing the path of routine and the unknown longing for something more. The stick figure's eyes glance longingly toward this direction, hinting at a deep, unfulfilled desire for change.

>In the background, behind the staircase, a minimalist cityscape silhouette can be seen through a large window with thick black outlines. The sky is an indistinct blank white, devoid of vibrant color, reinforcing the sense of a life lacking excitement.

>The color palette is uniform and monochrome with solid white fills and black outlines consistent across all elements, ensuring clarity in the depiction of an autopilot existence. The tone of the image is somber yet gently comedic due to the exaggerated proportions and expressive features, maintaining the playful integrity of the cartoon style.

>Overall, the image portrays a simplistic yet profound moment of introspection, making the viewer contemplate the feeling of living on autopilot while expressing it through a coherent, stylized cartoon world.

1ls5jqq,StableDiffusion,BeltOut: An open source pitch-perfect (SINGING!@#$) voice-to-voice timbre transfer model based on ChatterboxVC,"Hello! My name is Shiko Kudo, I'm currently an undergraduate at National Taiwan University. I've been around the sub for a long while, but... today is a bit special. I've been working all this morning and then afternoon with bated breath, finalizing everything with a project I've been doing so that I can finally get it into a place ready for making public. It's been a couple of days of this, and so I've decided to push through and get it out today on a beautiful weekend. AHH, can't wait anymore, here it is!!:

They say timbre is the only thing you can't change about your voice... well, not anymore.

**BeltOut** ([HF](https://huggingface.co/Bill13579/beltout), [GH](https://github.com/bill13579/beltout)) is **the world's first *pitch-perfect*, zero-shot, voice-to-voice timbre transfer model with *a generalized understanding of timbre and how it affects delivery of performances***. It is based on ChatterboxVC. As far as I know it is the first of its kind, being able to deliver eye-watering results for timbres it has never *ever* seen before (all included examples are of this sort) on many singing and other extreme vocal recordings.

It is explicitly different from existing voice-to-voice Voice Cloning models, in the way that it is not just entirely unconcerned with modifying anything other than timbre, but is even more importantly *entirely unconcerned with the specific timbre to map into*. The goal of the model is to learn *how* differences in vocal cords and head shape and all of those factors that contribute to the immutable timbre of a voice affects delivery of vocal intent in general, so that it can guess how the same performance will sound out of such a different base physical timbre.

This model represents timbre as just a list of 192 numbers, the **x-vector**. Taking this in along with your audio recording, the model creates a new recording, guessing how the same vocal sounds and intended effect would have sounded coming out of a different vocal cord.

In essence, instead of the usual `Performance -> Timbre Stripper -> Timbre ""Painter"" for a Specific Cloned Voice`, the model is a timbre shifter. It does `Performance -> Universal Timbre Shifter -> Performance with Desired Timbre`.

This allows for unprecedented control in singing, because as they say, timbre is the only thing you truly cannot hope to change without literally changing how your head is shaped; everything else can be controlled by you with practice, and this model gives you the freedom to do so while also giving you a way to change that last, immutable part.

# Some Points

* Small, running comfortably on my 6gb laptop 3060
* *Extremely* expressive emotional preservation, translating feel across timbres
* Preserves singing details like precise fine-grained vibrato, shouting notes, intonation with ease
* Adapts the original audio signal's timbre-reliant performance details, such as the ability to hit higher notes, very well to otherwise difficult timbres where such things are harder
* Incredibly powerful, doing all of this with just a single x-vector and the source audio file. No need for any reference audio files; in fact you can just generate a random 192 dimensional vector and it will generate a result that sounds like a completely new timbre
* Architecturally, only 335 out of all training samples in the 84,924 audio files large dataset was actually ""singing with words"", with an additional 3500 or so being scale runs from the VocalSet dataset. Singing with words is emergent and entirely learned by the model itself, learning singing despite mostly seeing SER data
* Make sure to read the [technical report](https://github.com/Bill13579/beltout/blob/main/TECHNICAL_REPORT.md)!! Trust me, it's a fun ride with twists and turns, ups and downs, and so much more.

# Examples and Tips

The x-vectors, and the source audio recordings are both available on the repositories under the `examples` folder for reproduction.

`sd-01*.wav` on the repo, [https://youtu.be/5EwvLR8XOts](https://youtu.be/5EwvLR8XOts) (output) / [https://youtu.be/wNTfxwtg3pU](https://youtu.be/wNTfxwtg3pU) (input, yours truly)

`sd-02*.wav` on the repo, [https://youtu.be/KodmJ2HkWeg](https://youtu.be/KodmJ2HkWeg) (output) / [https://youtu.be/H9xkWPKtVN0](https://youtu.be/H9xkWPKtVN0) (input)

**[NEW]** [https://youtu.be/LccqjwzLh0Y](https://youtu.be/LccqjwzLh0Y) (output) / [https://youtu.be/k8PwwSJtayE](https://youtu.be/k8PwwSJtayE) (input)

**[NEW]** [https://youtu.be/E4r2vdrCXME](https://youtu.be/E4r2vdrCXME) (output) / [https://youtu.be/9mmmFv7H8AU](https://youtu.be/9mmmFv7H8AU) (input) (Note that although the input *sounds* like it was recorded willy-nilly, this input is actually after **more than a dozen takes**. The input is not random, if you listen closely you'll realize that if you do not look at the timbre, the rhythm, the pitch contour, and the intonations are all carefully controlled. The laid back nature of the source recording is intentional as well. Thus, only because *everything other than timbre is managed carefully*, when the model applies the timbre on top, it can sound realistic.)

Note that a very important thing to know about this model is that it is a *vocal timbre* transfer model. The details on how this is the case is inside the technical reports, but the result is that, unlike voice-to-voice models that try to help you out by fixing performance details that might be hard to do in the target timbre, and thus simultaneously either destroy certain parts of the original performance or make it ""better"", so to say, but removing control from you, this model will not do any of the heavy-lifting of making the performance match that timbre for you!!

You'll need to do that.

Thus, when recording with the purpose of converting with the model later, you'll need to be mindful and perform accordingly. For example, listen to this clip of a recording I did of Falco Lombardi from `0:00` to `0:30`: [https://youtu.be/o5pu7fjr9Rs](https://youtu.be/o5pu7fjr9Rs)

Pause at `0:30`. This performance would be adequate for many characters, but for this specific timbre, the result is unsatisfying. Listen from `0:30` to `1:00` to hear the result.

To fix this, the performance has to change accordingly. Listen from `1:00` to `1:30` for the new performance, also from yours truly ('s completely dead throat after around 50 takes).

Then, listen to the result from `1:30` to `2:00`. It is a marked improvement.

Sometimes however, with certain timbres like Falco here, the model still doesn't get it exactly right. I've decided to include such an example instead of sweeping it under the rug. In this case, I've found that a trick can be utilized to help the model sort of ""exaggerate"" its application of the x-vector in order to have it more confidently apply the new timbre and its learned nuances. It is very simple: we simply make the magnitude of the x-vector bigger. In this case by 2 times. You can imagine that doubling it will cause the network to essentially double whatever processing it used to do, thereby making deeper changes. There is a small drop in fidelity, but the increase in the final performance is well worth it. Listen from `2:00` to `2:30`.

You can do this trick in the Gradio interface.

Another tip is that in the Gradio interface, you can calculate a statistical average of the x-vectors of massive sample audio files; make sure to utilize it, and play around with the Chunk Size as well. I've found that the larger the chunk you can fit into VRAM, the better the resulting vectors, so a chunk size of 40s sounds better than 10s for me; however, this is subjective and your mileage may vary. Trust your ears.

# Supported Lanugage

The model was trained on a variety of languages, and not just speech. Shouts, belting, rasping, head voice, ...

As a baseline, I have tested Japanese, and it worked pretty well.

In general, the aim with this model was to get it to learn how different sounds created by human voices would've sounded produced out of a different physical vocal cord. This was done using various techniques while training, detailed in the technical sections. Thus, the supported types of vocalizations is vastly higher than TTS models or even other voice-to-voice models.

However, since the model's job is *only* to make sure your voice has a new timbre, the result will only sound natural if you give a performance matching (or compatible in some way) with that timbre. For example, asking the model to apply a low, deep timbre to a soprano opera voice recording will probably result in something bad.

Try it out, let me know how it handles what you throw at it!

# Closing

This ain't the closing, you kidding!?? I'm so incredibly excited to finally get this out I'm going to be around for days weeks months hearing people experience the joy of getting to suddenly play around with a infinite amount of new timbres from the one they had up, and hearing their performances. I know I felt that way...

I'm sure that a new model will come soon to displace all this, but, speaking of which...

# Call to train

If you read through the technical report, you might be surprised to learn among other things just how incredibly quickly this model was trained.

It wasn't without difficulties; each problem solved in that report was days spent gruelling over a solution. However, I was surprised myself even that in the end, with the right considerations, optimizations, and head-strong persistence, many many problems ended up with extremely elegant solutions that would have frankly never come up without the restrictions.

And this just proves more that people doing training locally isn't just feasible, isn't just interesting and fun (although that's what I'd argue is the most important part to never lose sight of), but incredibly important.

So please, train a model, share it with all of us. Share it on as many places as you possibly can so that it will be there always. This is how local AI goes round, right? I'll be waiting, always, and hungry for more.

1ls544m,StableDiffusion,What's the highest quality i2v possible on 5090?,"So I've been in to AI from the start, I have printed canvases going back to SD 1.5 in my living room, I love everything about it and an reasonably comfortable with comfy.

Regarding ai video experience, I've pretty much tested each be model and it came out for fun and to see where we are in terms of real usability for real world cases.

Well a real world cases has come up to get a friend out of a hole. I work as a photographer and was shooting a wedding with a videographer, he's been at it 20 years and is very experienced but has somehow lost the shot of the bride and groom walking back down the aisle, this could be disastrous for him as one tricky bride can ruin a reputation and I know he's distraught.

At this point she is unaware, and I happen to have a good few high quality/resolution stills which I attempted to animate. They look pretty amazing from a distance of you squint, but these are real people and their faces just aren't detailed enough and loose consistency. I spent a few hours at it last night trying flf and single image i2v.

Speed is not a concern as it usually has been in my messing around with my own video generations, so I'm not sure really what the absolute optimumum quality can be pulled out to help with this situation from my new 5090, assuming that most speed ups degrade quality.

Is there a way to use a reference image to swap faces throughout such as reactor after the initial generation considering there are two faces? I only tried reactor once a good while ago. I'm considering splitting the generated video in half from 1024*720 to 512*720 as they couple are centrally framed so could potentially have only one of them in each video and then rejoin but that feels convoluted.

Maybe there is a great technique/workflow/solution I'm missing. I've increased steps which helped a bit, gone higher than 720p which also helped but hasn't got it to the stage that I think it would pass for a few seconds in a 5 minute video, I mean it might at first watch but after a rewatch they'll probably notice.

I'm using wan 720p i2v, I know 2.2 is coming so maybe that might be a further improvement, but he needs to get there fun delivered in the coming week. Just to note he doesn't need much of them walking down the aisle, it's just a few seconds as long as it's there, my tests have been on 81 frames, interpolated and I'll upscale properly once I've got a decent result.

Any other suggestions or workflows for this would be greatly appreciated!","['My advice is to use paid services with first - last frame options.

1lrxzzv,StableDiffusion,YuzuUI: A New Frontend for SD WebUI,"I was frustrated with the UX of SD WebUI, so I built a separate frontend UI app: [https://github.com/crstp/sd-yuzu-ui](https://github.com/crstp/sd-yuzu-ui)

Features:

* Saves tab states and restores generated images after restarting the app
* Applies batch setting changes across multiple tabs (e.g., replace prompts across tabs)
* Significantly reduces memory usage, even with many open tabs
* Offers more advanced autocompletion

It's focused on txt2img. The UI looks pretty much like the original WebUI, but the extra features make it way easier to work with lots of prompts.

If you often generate lots of txt2img images across multiple tabs in WebUI, this might be useful for you.","['No inpaint?', 'What is on the backend?']","['No inpaint?', 'What is on the backend?']",37,7,0.85,News,1751677176.0

1lrrdyi,StableDiffusion,Can we take a moment to appreciate how insane Flux Kontext dev is?,"Just wanted to drop some thoughts because I’ve been seeing some people throwing shade at Flux Kontext dev and honestly… I don’t get it.

I’ve been messing with AI models and image gen since late 2022. Back then, everything already felt like magic, but it was kinda hard to actually gen/edit images the way I wanted. You’d spend a lot of time inpainting, doing weird workarounds, or just Photoshopping it by hand.

And now… we can literally prompt edits. Like, “oh, I want to change this part” and boom, the model can just do it (most of the time lol). Sure, sometimes you still need to do some manual touch-ups, upscaling, or extra passes, but man, the fact we can even *do this* locally on our PCs is just surreal to me.

I get that nothing’s perfect, but some posts I see like “ehh, Kontext dev kinda sucks” really make me stop and go: bro… this is crazy tech. We’re living in a timeline where this stuff is just available to us.

1lrmnfj,StableDiffusion,"I built a GUI tool for FLUX LoRA manipulation - advanced layer merging, face and style pre-sets, subtraction, layer zeroing, metadata editing and more.  Tried to build what I wanted, something easy.","Hey everyone,

I've been working on a tool called LoRA the Explorer - it's a GUI for advanced FLUX LoRA manipulation. Got tired of CLI-only options and wanted something more accessible.

**What it does:**

* Layer-based merging (take face from one LoRA, style from another)
* LoRA subtraction (remove unwanted influences)
* Layer targeting (mute specific layers)
* Works with LoRAs from any training tool

**Real use cases:**

* Take facial features from a character LoRA and merge with an art style LoRA
* Remove face changes from style LoRAs to make them character-neutral
* Extract costumes/clothing without the associated face (Gandalf robes, no Ian McKellen)
* Fix overtrained LoRAs by replacing problematic layers with clean ones
* Create hybrid concepts by mixing layers from differnt sources

The demo image shows what's possible with layer merging - taking specific layers from different LoRAs to create someting new.

It's free and open source. Built on top of kohya-ss's sd-scripts.

GitHub: [github.com/shootthesound/lora-the-explorer](https://github.com/shootthesound/lora-the-explorer)

Happy to answer questions or take feedback. Already got some ideas for v1.5 but wanted to get this out there first.

Notes: I've put a lot of work into edge cases! Some early flux trainers were not great on metadata accuracy, I've implemented loads of behind the scenes fixes when this occurs (most often in the Merge tab).  If a merge fails, I suggest trying concat mode (tickbox on the gui).

The merge failures are FAR less likely on the Layer merging tab, as this technique extracts layers and inserts into a new lora in a different way, making it all the more robust.  I may for version 1.5, harness an adaption of this technique for the regular merge tool.  But for now I need sleep and wanted to get this out!","[""Thank you SO much for explaining a bit of block and layer architecture in your GitHub post.

On the most difficult old TV series ""Journey to the West"" to super-resolution and restore, I tried 7 or 8 different methods, and finally found that the open source effect after fine-tuning is really good, and it is much better than the strongest topaz in character consistency, noise reduction, and image restoration.","['And which open source model did you use?', 'https://preview.redd.it/xlxe9h87evaf1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=61e8414260dca17c94319e9a1c2e8abe3c805f21', 'Not revealing how you did that in an open source community is akin to marketing closed source alternatives.
