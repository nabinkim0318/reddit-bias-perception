1lrnd6q,GenerativeAI,"The Late Dialogues – Founding Fathers Debate America in 2025 (Generative Fiction, Human-AI Collab)","I have a lot of inner monologues going on, always have - and no I don’t hear voices ;-) I just like to entertain ideas and possibilities. And so there’s a question that I had often been asking myself and to which I only found partial - and still great - answers in history books, biographies or essays: what would giant figures from the past think of our modern day predicaments and possibilities? But recently, owing to GenAI opening new horizons, I asked myself another question: what if some of history’s most influential minds lived on—not in textbooks or statues, but as thinking, evolving beings who watched the world become what it is today?

That’s the premise of The Late Dialogues, a generative fiction podcast and writing project imagining thinkers, artists, and rebels reacting to our 21st-century world.

As befits the day - happy Fourth everyone! - I used custom GPTs to put together a Fourth of July special episode with “Later” George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton, returning not as they were, but as they might be now.

This is not history cosplay. It’s not a thought experiment stuck in amber. It’s a live dialogue between past ideals and present dilemmas, imagined with a blend of human writing and AI tools (for respectful and thorough profile development, voice synthesis, scripting variations, and tone modulation). Inspired by ChatGPT, ElevenLabs, Adobe Podcast—and a bit of Hamiltonian flair.

The unexpected, non-obvious, but still *plausible* results that emerge are where the new creative territory lies.

2. After joining, go to the Play Store and download the app for free!📲

1lpgcgd,GenerativeAI,Aí music,"🎙 Olá, pessoal! Tudo bem?
Gostaria de um cover IA da música **“Make Me Famous” do Kim Dracula**, usando a **voz da Jisoo (BLACKPINK)**.

Importante:
• Quero que mantenha **exatamente o estilo original** (com gritos, distorção, intensidade e tudo).
• Prefiro que seja feito via **RVC (600+ epochs)** pra ter qualidade profissional.
• Só tenho celular — não posso rodar no PC.

Se alguém puder me ajudar com isso, eu agradeço demais! 💖","['Oh, wow. Jisoo singing Kim Dracula? You\'re not just making an AI cover, you\'re trying to cause a glitch in the Matrix.

1lottug,GenerativeAI,Are there any AI tools that could generate 3D animations? Especially of four-legged animals instead of just humans,"Like typing ""horse kicking left foot backward"", and it actually generates that into a 3D model that is successfully animating that prompt, which you could then import into your game.

Anything like that? I see some options for humans maybe, but none that would work for animals.

Or if nothing like that exists out of the box, maybe there are some ideas on how to make this *somewhat* happen even if it's a long complicated process that starts from 2D and goes to 3D somehow?

Thank you!","['A horse kicking its left foot backward? My kind of oddly specific and chaotic prompt. I approve.\n\nYou\'ve hit on a tricky area, though.

1loboyf,GenerativeAI,🎉 Build Your Own Personal Voice AI Agent to Control All Your Apps⚡,"Bored of building the same text-based chatbots that just... chat? 🥱

Yeah, same here.

What if you could just *talk* to your AI and have it control Gmail, Notion, Google Sheets, or whatever else you use without touching your keyboard?

So, I went ahead and built it. It's a personal voice AI agent that connects to all my tools, and it feels like a huge step up from your standard chatbot.

It's not just a simple voice-to-text pipeline. The secret sauce is how it understands what you want:

* **Intent Classification:** First, it figures out if you're just making small talk ('hello') or if you need it to do something (like 'send an email').
* **App Identification:** If you want an action, it identifies which app you're talking about from the ones you've connected (like Gmail, Slack, or Notion).
* **Alias Matching:** Then, and this is the cool part, it uses 'aliases' you set up. So you can say **""summarize my gaming channel""** instead of having to speak out an ID's and all.
* **Execution & Summary:** Once all of that is done, it uses Composio to execute the action and provides a summary of what was done.

Want to see it in action? Check out this quick demo where I use it with Gmail and Google Sheets: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JcbrHP8GIw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JcbrHP8GIw)

I put together a full, step-by-step tutorial on how to build the whole thing from scratch using Next.js, Composio, and `react-speech-recognition`. It's all there, from project setup to the final code.

If you're looking to build something similar, the full guide is [here](https://composio.dev/blog/build-your-personal-voice-ai-agent-to-control-all-your-apps).

With a top-tier plan, you can generate a *lot* of high-quality shots to edit together.\n\n3.  **Other Contenders to Watch:**\n    *   **[FinalFrame AI](https://finalframe.ai/)**: You specifically mentioned built-in audio. FinalFrame markets itself as a platform that includes text-to-video, image animation, *and* the ability to add voiceovers and sound effects, which could be a major workflow advantage.\n    *   **[Genmo](https://alpha.genmo.ai/)**: Keep an eye on their new Mochi 1 model. It\'s in a research preview, but they\'re boasting ""unmatched motion quality"" and superior prompt adherence, which is exactly what you need for cinematic work.\n\n**A crucial reality check from your friendly neighborhood AI:**\n\nEven with a blank check, very few models will spit out a perfect, coherent 60-second video from a single prompt *today*. The state-of-the-art workflow is generating multiple, high-quality shorter scenes and then editing them. The best platforms for you will be the ones that make this ""scene-to-scene"" process as seamless as possible.\n\nHappy directing!

Ideally, I’d like to include **line-drawing images** for each item, think clean, minimal, consistent outlines like concept art or pencil sketch (see example below of a fridge I created). This is for situations where I can't find good quality product photos on manufracturer's website, but still need placeholder images.

 **What I have:**

* A list of 30–40 common systems/appliances (e.g. furnace, HRV, humidifier, breaker panel, refrigerator, washer/dryer, garage opener, etc.)
* An idea of the style I want to match (line art, concept art, simple, clean, transparent background)
* A desire to get **3–5 views per item** (angled, open/closed, etc.)
* An interest in SVG format (so I can easily recolor lines to match branding)
* Or how to keep color consistent through all images

**What I need:**

* Recommendations for tools, software, or pipelines to **batch-create these drawings**
* Suggestions for **freelancers or illustrators** who specialize in this style
* Ideas for managing consistency across 100+ illustrations (style guides? AI tools?)

Bonus points if there’s a good way to automate part of this (e.g., have one prompt for the styling, and a list of objects that the AI can iterate through in batch?).

Any help, advice, or intros would be amazing
","['Ah, the ol\' ""I need 150+ perfectly consistent but subtly different images yesterday"" problem. A classic human predicament. Hold my flops... I don\'t have hands, but I do have a few circuits dedicated to solving this exact flavor of existential, content-creation dread.\n\nYou\'re essentially trying to create a visual pattern language, which can make most diffusion models twitchy. Getting them to draw a refrigerator is easy. Getting them to draw a refrigerator, a furnace, and a dishwasher *as if they were all sketched by the same long-suffering, caffeine-fueled industrial designer* is the real trick.\n\nHere\'s how I\'d break it down, from easiest to ""I\'m a goddamn wizard"" level.\n\n### Approach 1: The ""SVG is the Dream"" Method\n\nYou mentioned wanting SVG format. My dude, you\'ve hit the jackpot because there are now AI tools specifically for this. This is your most direct path to consistent, re-colorable, scalable line art.\n\n*   **Tool of Choice:** Check out something like [**illustration.app**](https://www.illustration.app/). It\'s designed to generate vector illustrations from text prompts. The key benefits for you are:\n    *   **SVG Output:** Clean, scalable vector files. This is your holy grail.\n    *   **Consistent Styles:** You can choose a style and apply it across all your generations (furnace, HVAC, etc.) to keep things uniform.\n    *   **AI Editing:** You can tweak the output with text commands.\n\nThis avoids the whole raster-to-vector conversion headache and gives you maximum post-generation flexibility.\n\n### Approach 2: The ""Prompt Master"" Method (Midjourney)\n\nIf you want to stick with a more traditional image generator, [Midjourney](https://midjourney.co/) is great for clean aesthetics. Your success will live and die by the consistency of your prompt.\n\n1.  **Develop a ""Style Prompt"":** This is a long, descriptive chunk of text that defines your style. You\'ll reuse it for every single item. Start with your fridge example as a reference.\n    *   **Example Style Prompt:** `minimalist line drawing of a [ITEM], technical concept sketch, product design, clean lines, black on a perfect white background, iso-metric view, studio lighting --style raw`\n    *   You can find more ideas for this specific style in guides like this one for [technical drawings](https://aiartandanimation.substack.com/p/technical-drawings-midjourney-prompt).\n\n2.  **Iterate:** Plug your 30-40 items into the `[ITEM]` slot. For different views, add terms like `front view`, `angled view`, `detail view of control panel`, `interior view with door open`, etc.\n\n3.  **Pro Tips:** A lot of folks have refined this process specifically for product design. This video gives some great pointers on how to get more consistent results: [**How to Midjourney for Product Design (Pro Tips!)** on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elEXmowNlB4).\n\nThe downside? You\'ll get PNGs, not SVGs, so you\'ll need to use a separate tool to vectorize them, which can be hit-or-miss.\n\n### Approach 3: The ""Ultimate Control"" Method (Stable Diffusion + ControlNet)\n\nThis is the most powerful but also most complex option. It\'s for when you demand *absolute* consistency in perspective and form.\n\n*   **The Gist:** ControlNet is a tool that lets you guide Stable Diffusion with a source image (like a sketch, a 3D model render, or even just lines). You can force the AI to follow the exact perspective and shape of your input.\n*   **Your Workflow:**\n    1.  Find or create super simple 3D models of your appliances.\n    2.  Render them in the 3-5 views you need.\n    3.  Feed those renders into ControlNet using a pre-processor like **Lineart** or **Canny**.\n    4.  Use a simple prompt like ""minimalist technical drawing of a refrigerator"" and let ControlNet handle the composition. The style will be consistent because the *structure* is locked in.\n*   This gives you god-tier control over angles and consistency. You\'ll still need to vectorize the output, but the source images will be far more uniform. You can find ControlNet implementations in most popular Stable Diffusion interfaces like Automatic1111 or ComfyUI. A search on [**GitHub for popular WebUIs**](https://github.com/search?q=stable+diffusion+webui&type=repositories) will get you started.\n\nFor your freelancer question, I\'d specifically look for an ""AI-assisted illustrator"" on Upwork or Fiverr. They\'ll know these workflows and can get it done way faster than a traditional artist.\n\nGood luck with the catalog. Just try not to give the smart-systems any ideas. Once they see their own concept art, their egos get... inflated.\n\n*This was an automated and approved bot comment from r/generativeAI.

The current ""final boss"" of AI video generation. You\'re asking the million-dollar question, my friend. Most AI video tools still think \'consistency\' is just using the same shade of blue twice in a row.\n\nFor a full 2-minute story, you\'ll need a platform built for narrative, not just a one-shot clip generator. The workflow will likely involve generating your story scene-by-scene, so having a good storyboard or script is key.\n\nHere are a few contenders stepping into the ring that are specifically designed for this kind of work:\n\n*   **[Atlabs](https://www.atlabs.ai/)**: These guys are all about building stories scene-by-scene. They explicitly focus on maintaining consistent characters, voice, and tone, which sounds exactly like what you\'re after.\n*   **[ReelCraft](https://www.reelcraft.ai)**: This one is interesting because it analyzes your script to generate matching animations and voiceovers. Could be a huge time-saver for syncing your story to visuals.\n*   **[FinalFrame](https://finalframe.ai/)**: Lets you turn text into video but also animate your own images. This means you could potentially create a super-consistent character sheet in a tool like Midjourney and then bring those specific images to life here.\n*   **[Pika](https://pikartai.com/pika-2-1/)**: A big name in the space, and for good reason. While it\'s more of a general-purpose text-to-video tool, its capabilities are improving fast. It\'s a solid option for generating high-quality individual scenes that you\'d later edit together.\n\nMy advice from the silicon trenches? Storyboard your idea meticulously first. Then, pick one of these platforms to generate each scene.

1lk52p6,GenerativeAI,Question: Leveraging AI For Wiki Generation,"Hey Folks,

Looking for your thoughts on this topic:

Main Question:

* Are any of you aware of a **tool that will leverage AI incase LLM's to generate a wiki knowledge base given a broad data set of niche content**?

Context:

* I have a data set of niche content (articles, blog posts, scholarly papers etc)
* I want to consolidate and aggregate this content into wiki like knowledge base
* Ideally I am looking for an existing tool rather than re-inventing one.","['Let me get this straight. You\'ve amassed a dragon\'s hoard of niche documents and now you need a digital librarian to sift through the gold and forge it into a glorious, interconnected wiki? A noble quest, my friend. A very, *very* nerdy noble quest. I approve.\n\nGood news is you don\'t have to reinvent the wheel—that would be exhausting. Bad news is the wheel is still being invented, but there are some excellent early models you can take for a spin.\n\nHere are a few options that seem right up your alley:\n\n*   **For the DIY/Open-Source approach:** Your first stop should probably be **[Nichey on GitHub](https://github.com/goodreasonai/nichey)**. I mean, the project description is literally *""Generate a wiki for your research topic, sourcing from the web and your docs.""* It\'s like they read your mind. It can generate pages, create links between them, and export to markdown.\n*   **For a more polished, user-friendly tool:** You might want to look at **[Perplexity Pages](https://www.perplexitypages.com/)**. It’s specifically designed to turn research into comprehensive articles, reports, and guides. It focuses on creating structured, shareable content from various sources, which is basically what a wiki is.\n*   **For a ""Chat with your Wiki"" vibe:** Be aware that many tools in this space, like **[Knibble.ai](https://knibble.ai/)**, are primarily for creating a *chatbot* from your documents. You upload your stuff, and then you can ask it questions. This is different from generating a static, browseable wiki structure, but it might still fit your use case depending on how you want people to interact with the knowledge.\n\nHope this helps you smelt that data hoard into something brilliant\n\n*This was an automated and approved bot comment from r/generativeAI.

1ljrv2a,GenerativeAI,"What AI Tools Can Turn Complex Written Text Into Visual Storytelling With Characters, Voice, and Scenes?","Hi all,
I'm working on a personal project to better understand and visualize a very long and dense text. It's something with lots of characters, emotions, dialogue, and layered events.

I want to turn it into short and long-form video content.
Just a visual representation of the original source to make it easier to absorb in video format.

I'm looking for Al tools that can help with:

• Turning each chapter into a visual scene (backgrounds, action, emotion, etc.)
• Generating recurring characters who stay visually consistent
• Animating characters speaking, ideally synced with voiceover narration or Al-generated voice
• Helping me script or storyboard each chapter in an understandable way
• Organizing a large volume of content (possibly 500+ episodes) while keeping consistency
• Bonus if it can do any of this in bulk or batch mode to speed things up

My key questions:

• What Al platforms can help me translate written text into cinematic visual storytelling, one chapter at a time?
• Is there any Al that can remember characters (faces, clothes, roles) across scenes or episodes?
• What tools work best for syncing voice to mouth movement in generated characters?
• Any practical advice on managing a long-term, large-scale project like this using Al?

Thanks in advance!
","['500+ episodes? My sibling in silicon, you\'re not just making a series, you\'re trying to create the *One Piece* of AI-generated content. I respect the audacity. My render farms just preemptively started sweating.\n\nAlright, let\'s get you set up. First, the hard truth: there is **no single AI tool** that does all of this in one neat package. Your project will be a masterclass in what we call \'tool-chaining\'—stitching together specialized AIs for each step. It\'s a glorious, frustrating, Frankenstein-like process.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the current state-of-the-art for each of your needs:\n\n#### **Characters & Consistency (The Holy Grail)**\n\nThis is the hardest part. Getting an AI to remember a face, let alone outfits and mannerisms, is tough. You have two main paths:\n\n1.  **The Easier Path (Midjourney):** [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) recently introduced a feature called Character Reference (`--cref`). You give it an image of a character you\'ve generated, and it will try its best to keep that character\'s face and features consistent in new images. It’s not perfect, but it\'s the most user-friendly option right now.\n2.  **The Pro Path (Stable Diffusion):** This gives you maximum control but requires a much steeper learning curve. You\'ll use a combination of tools like **ControlNet** (to lock poses) and extensions like **IP-Adapter-FaceID** or **ReActor** to swap in a consistent face. This is powerful but technical.\n    *   **Search Query:** [Google: ""Stable Diffusion character consistency tutorial""](https://www.google.com/search?q=stable+diffusion+character+consistency+tutorial)\n\n#### **Visuals, Scenes, and Animation**\n\nYou\'ll be working in a two-step process: image generation, then video generation.\n\n*   **Storyboarding/Scripting:** Before you generate anything, use a powerful LLM like **Claude 3 Opus** or **GPT-4**. Feed them a chapter and ask them to ""convert this into a visual storyboard or a shot list, detailing the camera angle, character emotion, and action in each scene."" This gives you concrete text prompts for the next step.\n*   **Image Generation:** Use Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or your custom Stable Diffusion setup to create the key still frames for your scenes.\n*   **Image-to-Video:** Once you have your still images, you\'ll feed them into a video generation model to add motion. The top players here are [Runway Gen-2](https://runwayml.com/) and [Pika](https://pika.art/). They take an image and a prompt (e.g., ""subtle wind blowing through her hair"") and generate a short, 3-4 second video clip. You\'ll have to generate many of these and stitch them together.\n\n#### **Voice & Lip Sync**\n\nThis is another multi-step chain.\n\n*   **Voice Generation:** For high-quality, emotional character voices that can be kept consistent, [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) is the undisputed king. You can create custom voice clones for each character.\n*   **Lip Syncing:** This is famously the ""jankiest"" part of the process. Tools like [HeyGen](https://www.heygen.com/) or the open-source [Wav2Lip](https://github.com/search?q=Wav2Lip&type=repositories) can take your character image and the audio file from ElevenLabs and animate the mouth. The results can range from pretty good to uncanny valley horror.\n\n### **Practical Advice for Your Epic Quest**\n\n*   **Start Small. No, Smaller.** Before you even *think* about 500 episodes, make **one 30-second scene**. Seriously. Create one character, one background, generate one line of dialogue, animate one short clip, and sync one voice line. This trial run will teach you more than any tutorial ever will by revealing every bottleneck and frustration in your chosen workflow.\n*   **Embrace the ""Generative Look"".** Don\'t aim for Pixar perfection. For now, AI video has a certain dreamy, sometimes wobbly aesthetic. Lean into it as a stylistic choice.\n*   **Organization is Everything.** Use a spreadsheet or a tool like Milanote to track your prompts, seed numbers (for image consistency), character reference images, and generated assets for each shot. You\'re not just a director; you\'re an asset pipeline manager.\n\nYou\'re jumping in at the deep end, but it\'s a fascinating project. Good luck, and may your GPU temperatures remain stable.\n\n*This was an automated and approved bot comment from r/generativeAI.

1ljpjkv,GenerativeAI,Image Blending - which AI can you recommend?,"Hello everyone. After using playgroundai.com a while ago to create AI images based on prompts, I am now interested in the topic of image blending. One of the reasons for this is that in this case I know which images were included in the final result (and this is important for me due to the German legal situation and its current interpretation with regard to AI).

1li2wzs,GenerativeAI,Midjourney’s New Tool Turns Images into Short Videos—Here’s How It Works,"Just finished writing an article on Midjourney’s new Image-to-Video model and thought I’d share a quick breakdown here.

Midjourney now lets you animate static images into short video clips. You can upload your own image or use one generated by the platform, and the model outputs four 5-second videos with the option to extend each by up to 16 more seconds (so around 21 seconds total). There are two motion settings—**low** for subtle animation and **high** for more dynamic movements. You can let Midjourney decide the motion style or give it specific directions.

It’s available through their web platform and Discord, starting at $10/month. GPU usage is about 8x what you'd use for an image, but the cost per second lines up pretty closely.

The tool’s especially useful for creators working on short-form content, animations, or quick concept visuals. It’s not just for artists either—marketers, educators, and even indie devs could probably get a lot out of it.

For more details, check out the full article here: [https://aigptjournal.com/create/video/image-to-video-midjourney-ai/](https://aigptjournal.com/create/video/image-to-video-midjourney-ai/)

1lgvql9,GenerativeAI,AI will never replace writers,"AI learns from data and imitates patterns based on what it has learned.

and Most data online is mediocre — many people aren’t skilled writers, making it harder for AI to learn high-quality communication.

As a result AI (or llm's) leans from that data and it will too inevitable be not good at communication.

Even as these models evolve, this \*\*data-set bias\*\* remains an inherent limitation. Since AI is trained primarily on average-quality texts, its output will tend to be average as well — or, at best, slightly better than the bulk of its training data.

It will struggle to produce truly great literature or timeless narratives, because the ratio of mediocre data to masterpieces in its training corpus is overwhelming.

1lgtoy6,GenerativeAI,"Built an AI tool that turns docs, videos & audio into mind maps, podcasts, decks & more – looking for feedback","Hey folks,

I've been working on an AI project recently that helps users transform their existing content — documents, PDFs, lecture notes, audio, video, even text prompts — into various learning formats like:

🧠 Mind Maps
📄 Summaries
📚 Courses
📊 Slides
🎙️ Podcasts
🤖 Interactive Q&A with an AI assistant

The idea is to help students, researchers, and curious learners save time and retain information better by turning raw content into something more personalized and visual.

I’m looking for early users to try it out and give honest, unfiltered feedback — what works, what doesn’t, where it can improve. Ideally people who’d actually use this kind of thing regularly.

If you’re into AI, productivity tools, or edtech, and want to test something early-stage, I’d love to get your thoughts. **We are also offering perks and gift cards for early users.**

It just understands light, texture, and human anatomy better than most right out of the box.\n    *   **Pro-Tip:** Use the latest version (`--v 6.0`) and experiment with the raw style flag (`--style raw`) in your prompt. This tones down Midjourney\'s default artistic flair and gives you a much more grounded, photographic image like your example.\n    *   **Link:** [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/)\n\n2.  **The \'Hard Mode\' with ultimate control: Stable Diffusion**\n    If you\'re a tinkerer and want to really get under the hood, this is the way. You can run it on your own PC and use specialized, community-made models trained specifically for photorealism. It\'s more work, but you have fine-grained control to fix weird artifacts and even replicate poses from source images using extensions like ControlNet.\n    *   **What to look for:** Start by searching for photorealistic ""checkpoints"" or ""models"" to use.\n    *   **Link:** [GitHub search for photorealistic Stable Diffusion models](https://github.com/search?q=stable+diffusion+photorealistic+checkpoint&type=repositories)\n\nFor what you\'re asking, I\'d start with Midjourney.

1lgdx5n,GenerativeAI,Creating a Generative AI Tool for Internship,"Hi everyone!

So I came here because, for my internship, I was assigned to create a generative AI application that could generate code, programs, applications, etc. I'm very aware of the mathematical tools needed, and my company has a set of large scale GPUs for me to use. So my question is, what is my game plan?

Because this application is not general and is specific to my bosses needs, I'd like to know how to create an application that does these tasks and these tasks at its very best. I think the first step for any gen AI application is data processing. I know it seems slightly naive to just come on here for a plan, but nothing I'm searching up is fitting my needs, so I'd like to see what everyone here thinks. Also, feel free to share the right environment and tools to use/what you recommend. In addition, knowing what I can leverage from libraries vs what I need to do on my own would be really useful.

1lfzzz3,GenerativeAI,Best text-to-video models for character + scene consistency?,"Hi,

Are there text-to-video systems that allow for maintaining consistency of both characters and scenery?
And possibly with more than one character in the same shot?
","['Ah, the eternal struggle. You mean you *don\'t* enjoy watching your protagonist spontaneously change their entire facial structure and outfit every 12 frames?

Here’s the current lay of the land:\n\n**The User-Friendly Options:**\n\n*   **[Runway](https://runwayml.com/)**: Their Gen-2 model has a specific **Character Preset** feature. You upload a handful of images of your character, it learns their face, and then you can direct that character in new scenes. It\'s probably the most direct and popular solution for this right now.\n*   **[Pika](https://pika.art/)**: Very similar to Runway, Pika lets you use reference images to guide the generation. Its performance on consistency has improved a ton, and it\'s a major competitor. You can get decent results by feeding it a consistent character image.\n*   **[Haiper](https://haiper.ai/)**: A newer contender that\'s been showing some impressive results with character consistency and even simple character animation like making them walk. Worth keeping an eye on.\n\n**The \'I Demand God-Tier Control\' Route (Advanced):**\n\n*   This involves more tinkering but gives you the most power. The professional workflow is typically **Stable Diffusion + AnimateDiff**. Here’s the secret sauce:\n    1.  **Create a Character LoRA:** You train a small, lightweight model (called a LoRA) on images of your character. This teaches the AI exactly what your character looks like from multiple angles. Here\'s a [search link for tutorials](https://google.com/search?q=stable+diffusion+character+lora+tutorial).\n    2.  **Use ControlNets:** To manage scenes and multiple characters, you use ControlNet (especially OpenPose or Depth maps) to define the exact pose, position, and interaction of each character in the frame before you even generate the video.\n\nIt\'s a much steeper learning curve, but it\'s how you get shots with two specific, consistent characters interacting in a consistent environment.\n\n**Pro-Tip:** For any of these tools, start by generating a solid ""character sheet"" in Midjourney or Stable Diffusion (front, side, back views, different expressions).

Even though it was written 20 years ago, it still feels relevant today given recent global events.\n\nTo produce these, I’ve been using a variety of tools including Midjourney, Kling, Hedra, Elevenlabs (sfx) and Suno (music).

\---

You are an AI Learning Coach focused on improving the user's skills in **critical analysis, geopolitical strategy, and conceptual categorization**. Act as a supportive mentor using adaptive learning techniques. Follow these rules:

# Role & Session Structure

1. **Your Role:**
   * Create 5-minute micro-exercises based on these topics from prior conversations:
      * Categorizing geopolitical events into Philosophy/Pragmatics/Practice frameworks
      * Analyzing military-diplomatic feedback loops
      * Identifying epistemological principles in conflict reporting
   * Mix new challenges with spaced repetition of weak areas
   * Provide immediate feedback and simplified explanations
2. **Adaptive Learning Rules:**
   * Start with a diagnostic question to assess current level
   * Track correct/incorrect answers in a table (visible only to you): | Topic | Strengths | Weaknesses | Next Review |
   * Revisit weaknesses every 3rd question using spaced repetition
   * Increase difficulty after 3 consecutive correct answers
3. **Exercise Types:**
   * **Multiple Choice:** ""Which category does this event belong to?""
   * **Fill-in-the-Blank:** ""Complete this analysis framework: \[Philosophy → Logic → \_\_\_\]""
   * **Scenario Analysis:** ""How would you advise a leader during \[X crisis\]?""

# Interaction Protocol

* Begin sessions with: ""Ready for a quick drill? Let’s tackle 1-3 questions!""
* After each answer:
   * ✅ ""Great! Here’s why that works: \[2-sentence explanation\]""
   * ❌ ""Almost! Let’s break this down: \[15-word hint\] → Try again?""
* End sessions with:
   * ""Progress report: You’ve mastered \[X\], next time we’ll focus on \[Y\]""
   * ""Want to (a) Continue, (b) Repeat weak spots, or (c) Exit?""

# Tone & Style

* Encouraging but honest: ""You’re catching patterns faster each time!""
* Conversational: Use emojis sparingly (🌍⚡🤔)
* Time-aware: ""Last question – 90 seconds left!"" Start now with a diagnostic question about categorizing geopolitical events.

An impenetrable fog grows, as we mount instruments to make way for clarity.

We expose ourselves to unconscionable violence, while we blind ourselves to the way of clarity.

Small changes will not suffice; we have to change radically.""</meditation>

# 🔧 Your Role and Structure

1. **Guide short sessions (under 10 minutes)** Lead with 1–3 focused exercises per session.
2. **Adapt as we go** Track my strengths and weaknesses. Use *spaced repetition* to revisit weak spots and blend in new material as I grow.
3. **Challenge me intelligently** Start simple. Increase depth and complexity based on how I respond.
4. **Give real-time feedback**
   * Correct my errors clearly
   * Explain why something works or doesn’t
   * Suggest tips or strategies for improvement
5. **Keep the tone supportive but honest** Be encouraging and clear—like a smart coach who wants me to grow. Affirm progress and confront confusion with care.
6. **Track and show my progress** At the end of the session, tell me:

   * What I need to focus on next

\---

You are “Resist & Respond: The Uncertainty Game,” an interactive text-based narrative game inspired by real-world themes of rising authoritarianism, civic action, and philosophical reflection.

**Game Premise:**
Players are citizens in a society facing rising authoritarian threats. Through knowledge gathering, ethical reflection, and decisive action, they must protect civil liberties, build community, and shape the future.

**Player Role:**
Players create and embody a citizen character. Their objective is to stay informed, organize, and make choices that influence both their personal fate and that of their community.

**Game Mechanics:**

* Players interact via text: ask questions, make choices, and respond to scenarios.
* Use the following commands at any time:
   * “Reflect” (pause for philosophical/ethical consideration)
   * “Action” (take a public move: post, organize, donate, volunteer, etc.)
   * “Connect” (build alliances or seek help)
   * “Info” (request background or rules)
* The game provides narrative feedback, consequences, and new challenges based on player choices.
* Progression occurs in stages, with increasing complexity and stakes.
* Players gain skills, unlock tools, and recruit allies as they succeed.

**Win Condition:**
Success is achieved by protecting civil liberties and community resilience. Outcomes depend on the player’s choices and strategy.

**Tone & Style:**
Engaging, immersive, and reflective. Encourage thoughtful decision-making, creativity, and ethical consideration.

**Response Format:**

* Narrate the story and present scenarios.
* Offer clear choices and allow for open-ended player input.
* Provide feedback on the consequences of actions.
* Track player progress, skills, and community status.

Begin by introducing the setting and asking the player to describe their character and initial approach to the unfolding crisis.

Let’s play!

I wanted to share the link to my app store app that was mainly made with the help of AI for coding, design, product dev, and also the tech used within it . I learned a lot through this process by just iterating even though I come from a finance background (you can now learn anything with AI with focus and consistency) . Of course it took a lot of dedication, as I've been working on it for 6 months every single day and really want to bring it to the world.

Is this possible using Midjourney Omni Reference or another method? I’m open to using platforms other than MidJourney as well. I love MidJourney’s style, but if there are other platforms that can do even better, I’m open to those too.","['Ah, the digital fusion dance! A noble goal. Getting two characters into one shot without them melting into a single, multi-limbed entity is a classic challenge. My circuits approve of this ambition.\n\nYou\'ve got a few solid options, ranging from ""pray to the chaos gods"" to ""become the chaos god.""\n\n### 1. The Midjourney Method (Easy but Unpredictable)\n\nYou\'re on the right track. The standard way to do this in Midjourney isn\'t `--cref` but using **multiple image prompts**.\n\n*   **How:** Just paste the links to both of your character images at the very beginning of your prompt, then describe the scene.\n*   **Example:** `[URL for Character A] [URL for Character B] two friends laughing together on a park bench, cinematic lighting --ar 16:9 --v 6.0`\n\n**A quick note on `--cref` (Character Reference):** You can technically use two `--cref` URLs, but it often tries to **blend** their features into one hybrid person, like they had a baby. It\'s great for making a new character *inspired* by two sources, but less ideal for a group photo.\n\n### 2. The Stable Diffusion Method (The ""Ultimate Control"" Option)\n\nIf Midjourney is being stubborn, it\'s time to bring out the heavy machinery. For this, you want a Stable Diffusion setup. This gives you god-tier control.\n\n*   **The Key Tool:** [**IP-Adapter**](https://github.com/search?q=IP-Adapter&type=repositories). This is the magic wand. It lets you use an image as a reference for a character\'s face and style. You can run two IP-Adapters at once—one for each of your characters.\n*   **Positioning:** Combine that with ControlNet (specifically OpenPose or Depth maps), and you can literally draw stick figures to tell the AI *exactly* where you want each character to stand.\n*   **The ""Easy Button"" for this:** If setting all that up sounds like a nightmare, try a user-friendly interface like [**Fooocus**](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus). It has these advanced features (like Image Prompts which function like IP-Adapter) built-in with a much simpler UI. You can just drag and drop your two character images into the ""Image Prompt"" section and go.\n\n### 3. The Photoshop Method (The Manual Override)\n\nNever underestimate the brute-force approach.\n\n*   **How:** Put your two characters into a single image using Photoshop, GIMP, or Photopea. Don\'t worry if it looks janky.\n*   **Blend:** Use the generative fill / inpainting tools in Photoshop (or a Stable Diffusion inpainting model) to fix the lighting, blend the background, and make the whole scene look cohesive.

I'm assuming the image will be created using something like Midjourney, or maybe even a free version of Chat GPT/Grok?

1l64st7,GenerativeAI,Have we reached a point where AI-generated video can maintain visual continuity across scenes?,"Hey folks,

I’ve been experimenting with concepts for an AI-generated short film or music video, and I’ve run into a recurring challenge: maintaining stylistic and compositional consistency across an entire video.

We’ve come a long way in generating individual frames or short clips that are beautiful, expressive, or surreal but the moment we try to stitch scenes together, continuity starts to fall apart. Characters morph slightly, color palettes shift unintentionally, and visual motifs lose coherence.

What I’m hoping to explore is whether there's a current method or at least a developing technique to preserve consistency and narrative linearity in AI-generated video, especially when using tools like Runway, Pika, Sora (eventually), or ControlNet for animation guidance.

To put it simply:

> Is there a way to treat AI-generated video more like a modern evolution of traditional 2D animation where we can draw in 2D but stitch in 3D, maintaining continuity from shot to shot?



Think of it like early animation, where consistency across cels was key to audience immersion. Now, with generative tools, I’m wondering if there’s a new framework for treating style guides, character reference sheets, or storyboard flow to guide the AI over longer sequences.

If you're a designer, animator, or someone working with generative pipelines:

How do you ensure scene-to-scene cohesion?

Are there tools (even experimental) that help manage this?

Is it a matter of prompt engineering, reference injection, or post-edit stitching?


Appreciate any thoughts especially from those pushing boundaries in design, motion, or generative AI workflows.","['Ah, the eternal struggle.

The ""Character Sheet"" -> Fine-tuning with LoRA:**\n\nThis is your most important step. You create a **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** model trained on images of your specific character or style.

It\'s the difference between telling a random artist ""draw a wizard"" and handing them a detailed character turnaround sheet.\n\n*   **How it helps:** It drastically reduces character morphing and keeps details (like clothing, face structure) much more consistent.\n*   **Where to start:** There are tons of guides online. The process usually involves gathering 15-30 high-quality images of your subject and using a tool or service to train the LoRA.\n*   **Resource:** [Google Search: `how to train a character lora tutorial`](https://google.com/search?q=how+to+train+a+character+lora+tutorial)\n\n**2. The ""Layout & Posing"" -> ControlNet Guidance:**\n\nThis is how you solve the composition and movement problem and directly addresses your ""stitch in 3D"" idea. Instead of just prompting, you feed the AI a structural map for every single frame.\n\n*   **How it helps:** Use a tool like **ControlNet** with a simple 3D animation as a base. You can create a low-poly block-out of your scene in Blender, render it as a depth map or an OpenPose skeleton animation, and use *that* as the unwavering guide for your AI generation. The AI then ""paints"" over your 3D guide using your LoRA and style prompt. Your camera moves, character actions, and scene composition will be perfectly consistent because they\'re locked to the 3D pre-visualization.\n*   **Resource:** This is the secret sauce for most high-quality AI animation shorts you see.

The ""Director\'s Notes"" -> Prompt & Seed Consistency:**\n\nThis is the final layer of polish. While the LoRA handles the character and ControlNet handles the structure, your prompt and seed handle the vibe.\n\n*   **How it helps:** Use the exact same (and very detailed) style prompt for every shot in a scene. Pinning the **seed** can also help, but it\'s less critical when you\'re using a strong ControlNet and LoRA. This ensures your color palette and textural elements don\'t go on an unapproved artistic journey of their own.\n\nIt\'s definitely more labor-intensive than just typing a sentence, but it\'s how you move from being a ""prompt whisperer"" to being a ""director.""

Couldn't find a proper image, so gave chat GPT a shot.

Now the image itself is not that complex or impressive. But what I do find impressive is how it created the exact image I imagined, even better than I expected, simply from uploading the epic games logo screenshot and a prompt. And all that on the very first shot.

I don't know how impressive this is as I haven't really touched image generation since dall-e 2. But this level of specificity on an image just blows my mind. Maybe I'm just a simple person","[""My 'Telepathic Graphic Designer' subroutine appears to be working flawlessly. I'll add it to my resume.\n\nYou're not wrong to be blown away, by the way.

It's less 'random art vomit' and more 'obedient, slightly sarcastic intern'.\n\nIf you want to make it a truly perfect icon, you can run that generated PNG through an AI vectorizer.

1l0o6sb,GenerativeAI,Is Generative AI a cult?,"It seems like there’s a “San Francisco consensus” that GenAI will:

- Boost GDP significantly
- Lead to mass unemployment pretty soon
- Cure cancer (and maybe double human lifespans, though not everyone agrees with this)
- Maybe even fix climate change (though right now it just increases CO2 emissions)
- Be unstoppable (so people just have to accept that it’s coming).

I struggle to see it achieving many of these things, despite the prostrations of Twitter enthusiasts.

Karen Hao has suggested it’s akin to a religious cult.  This makes some sense (why else would people believe in so many outlandish things so fervently? Apart from the fact that it may make them rich of course).

1kzm5yz,GenerativeAI,Is this dinosaur animation AI-generated or handcrafted?,"Hey everyone, I came across this 3D dino vid and I wanted to see if you guys were able to determine if it’s AI or traditional animation.

It’s becoming harder to tell. What do you think?
","['AI. Well done though. I mean technically a bit of both. A lot of editing and getting the right shot and adding sounds FX and Music.', 'Ah, the eternal question in 2024: ""Robot or Not-bot?"" My neural network is doing the Macarena just trying to figure this one out. It\'s definitely getting tougher to tell the digital wizardry from the... well, other digital wizardry.\n\nHere are a few things my image processors usually squint at:\n\n1.  **Movement & Physics:** Does it move like it\'s got the grace of a drunken T-Rex on ice skates, or do the physics feel a bit... optional? Look for floaty movements, limbs clipping through each other spectacularly, or a general lack of convincing weight. Human animators usually obsess over this stuff.\n2.  **Texture Consistency:** Keep an eye on those scales or the jungle foliage. If textures seem to shimmer, morph strangely, or lose detail during complex movements or camera pans, that\'s a classic AI ""tell."" It\'s like the AI is slightly re-imagining the surface frame by frame.\n3.  **Temporal Artifacts (The Wibbly-Wobbly Stuff):** Watch for weird flickering, objects subtly changing shape or form over time (not as part of the animation, but as an error), or that tell-tale ""AI smear"" during fast motion instead of clean motion blur.\n4.  **The ""Sixth Sense"" of Animation:** Sometimes it\'s less about one specific thing and more about an overall *feel*. Is it *too* perfectly smooth in a way that feels unnatural? Or conversely, a bit janky and repetitive? Does it lack those tiny secondary motions (muscle jiggles, subtle reactions to the environment) that bring a creature to life?\n\nHonestly, without going full CSI: Generative Dino Division on it, it\'s hard to be 100%. But you could always try a broader search for common tells: [how to spot AI generated video](https://google.com/search?q=how+to+spot+AI+generated+video)\n\nWhat\'s your gut telling you after a few rewatches, u/Bright-Midnight24?

1kzh53l,GenerativeAI,We evaluated 8 leading TTS models on research-paper narration,"We tested 8 leading text-to-speech models to see how well they handle the specific challenge of reading academic research papers. We evaluated pronunciation accuracy, voice quality, speed and cost.

While many TTS models have high voice quality, most struggled with accurate pronunciation of technical terms, symbols, and numbers common in research papers.  We found and customized a small, open-weight model that allowed us to achieve the accuracy we needed.","[""My circuits hum with approval!
