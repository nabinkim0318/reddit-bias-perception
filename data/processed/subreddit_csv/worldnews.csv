Peterson in particular has a buy-back clause with Repsol with the understanding that Repsol will continue to run the company.

With a couple hundred kilometers of ski slopes with direct access - and probably at least five times that in the closer neighborhood - the number of guests every winter was enormous. There was also summer tourism, although it was both in smaller numbers and more physically spread out, which made it far less obvious.\n\nEven back then, every local complained about tourists, but they also had jobs because of them so nobody *really* minded.\n\nOver the decades things changed quite a bit, which is probably why people went from grumbling but happy they had a stable job to annoyed and protesting about it. The reasons for that are manifold, but lets go through the most obvious in no particular order:\n\n*The demographics of workers in the tourism sector*: when I was a kid, a significant share of people who worked directly in tourism-related jobs were locals, or at the very least lived locally. Today, some owners are still locals, but the employees are mostly from eastern Europe who come for their job and leave once the season's over. In other words, of the locals who are annoyed by tourists, fewer and fewer are directly involved in the business and don't feel like tourism is benefiting them. Whether that's true is a different question, but the change is more than obvious.\n\n*The demographics of tourists*: when you look back 40 years at the type of people who spent their vacation skiing in the Alps and compare them to today, thee change is significant. One can't say that apr√®s-ski is to blame for everything, but it has definitely expanded as the types of guests changed. In other words, when I was a kid what we saw were a lot more family vacations, whereas today it's late teens and tweens here to party the night away.\n\n*The upswing of mass tourism*: Take any famous tourism location in the world, like the leaning tower of Pisa or just some mountaintop in a small town in the Alps that has an access road rated for a bus. Instead of single families that book hotels or bed & breakfasts locally, suddenly a narrow mountain road is taken over by dozens of buses every day with tourists that are collected from all over the state. They're only here for a half a day, take up space, swarm around like flies and don't even spend their money here.\n\n*The rise of off-season tourism*: when I was a kid, my hometown basically fell asleep or hibernated for months at a time twice every year. After the winter season was over and until the start of the summer season and also the other way around. Today these off-seasons still exist, but instead of hotels or bed & breakfasts closing, they just offer their services at lower rates to attract off-season tourism.\n\n*The (lack of) separation between tourism and residential zones*: AirBnB isn't the sole instigator, but they were certainly to blame for making the concept popular. With tourists entering residential areas more and more, locals often feel that they're being invaded in their safe spaces.\n\nBeing annoyed by tourists is one thing,. but actually doing something about them and going as far as protesting against or attacking them is a level of escalation you don't see unless their reasons are significant enough. I would say, based on first- and secondhand experience that many small and often unique issues build up to create a greater whole.\n\nThe anti-tourism sentiment hasn't been nearly this aggressive in the past, which I can only attribute to local politicians not doing enough to protect locals. Some cities, take Venice for example, mostly get it right, but others are probably too greedy for a few more tourism dollars. It's a simple as that."", 'I‚Äôm surprised it took this long. Cities in lower cost countries like Mexico, Portugal and Spain are being overrun with digital nomads and retirees from more expensive countries  relocating to enjoy a cheaper lifestyle. In doing so they are pushing the native people out of the cities since rents, goods, services etc increase astronomically‚Ä¶.still not so expensive to the relocating expats but it totally pushes out the native people. While Airbnb is also at fault the real problem is the people relocating long term and taking over neighborhoods. That can be addressed by making it more difficult for non Mexican Nationals to stay in Mexico a long time by more restrictive laws like Spain is doing. This will only stop if the Mexican Government acts or the protests continue and grow which will make the expats feel unwelcome.', ""The post is misleading.\n\n\nIt's not a protest against mass tourism. It's a protest against the foreigners living here illegally, gentrifying more areas."", 'These same people probably loudly proclaim racism if their compatriots are deported from America.']","['I went to Kyoto and they were complaining about tourists, I went to Hawaii and they were complaining about Japanese tourists, I went to Europe and they complained about tourists.\n\nI live in a town with a lot of tourists and we complain too.

There's no reason to be blocking the World Food Programme and other NGOs from operating in parallel with GHF, and let the Gazans go to whichever provider meets their needs in a safe manner.\n\nAt the same time, this is the same Israeli government that blocked all food aid to Gaza for months.  If that isn't deliberate use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, then I don't know what is.\n\n(Anticipating the inevitable replies, I will say this up front: the fact that all the Palestinians in Gaza didn't drop dead of starvation isn't somehow proof that everything is really fine and the food situation isn't as bad as they say.  One of the IPC criteria for phase 5 (famine) is 2 excess deaths per 100,000 people per day.

1lqxo5t,worldnews,Secret recordings unite Colombian politicians against attempt to overthrow President Petro,,"[""I'll provide some basic context:\n\nAlvaro Leyva is an old man with a very long political career in Colombia with a lot of hints about being shady, he gets named foreing minister by Petro.\n\nDuring this time Leyva was apparently a die hard Petro believer, suggesting even that the constitution should be changed to allow for Petro's releection.\n\nEventually he's forced to resign as he was going to be sanctioned because he followed illegal orders by Petro to take away a contract to a company Petro doesn't like to print the country's passports.\n\nAfter his exist as a minister, he seems to have been completely sidelined and ignored by Petro.\n\nEarly this year he posts two very dramatic public letters addressed to Petro were he recounted multiple bizarre and embarrassing incidentes regarding Petro's behavior, including giving a speech in Germany to goverment officials saying that the fall of the Berlin Wall was a great tragedy (this one is 100% true) and that in several occasions during state visits he would disappear to go party and do cocaine (he didn't provide evidence, yet Petro has dozens of times disappeared without clear explanation, his behavior is often erratic and as far as 2023 a well known leftist journalist published and op-ed saying she had insider sources telling her the president is a cocaine addict). And just generally saying he was unfit to be president and should resign.\n\nRecently El Pais from Spain published a few snippets of Leyva talking to an unknown someone where he generally said that Petro should be removed because completely unfit and his vice president should be made president until the next elections, that he was trying to get in contact with the Rubio/the White House for support and that a great national political agreement should be reached to remove Petro, involving opposition politicians, business leaders, congress, the vice president, even the ELN and Gulf Clan (the country's two largest illegal armed groups).\n\nSo far there's no evidence beyond this that there was any actual plan, that any of these people knew or agreed to any of this, everyone mentioned by Leyva has come out and denied it (even the illegal armed groups, lol) and all political sides have expressed that the president must finish its constitutional presidential term.\n\nSo it seems to be little more than the delusions of grandeur of an irrelevant, elderly, betrayed ass kisser thinking he could be at center of a grand, international conspiracy to have a president removed. But of course, a proper investigation will have to be conducted.\n\nAnd heck, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Petro's goverment may as well be called a really dumb tropical/cocaine Game of Thrones, everyone is blackmailing everyone, backstabbing, plots upon plots, endless bizarre characters trying to court favor with the unstable king in order to advance their own interests.

And just generally saying he was unfit to be president and should resign.\n\nRecently El Pais from Spain published a few snippets of Leyva talking to an unknown someone where he generally said that Petro should be removed because completely unfit and his vice president should be made president until the next elections, that he was trying to get in contact with the Rubio/the White House for support and that a great national political agreement should be reached to remove Petro, involving opposition politicians, business leaders, congress, the vice president, even the ELN and Gulf Clan (the country's two largest illegal armed groups).\n\nSo far there's no evidence beyond this that there was any actual plan, that any of these people knew or agreed to any of this, everyone mentioned by Leyva has come out and denied it (even the illegal armed groups, lol) and all political sides have expressed that the president must finish its constitutional presidential term.\n\nSo it seems to be little more than the delusions of grandeur of an irrelevant, elderly, betrayed ass kisser thinking he could be at center of a grand, international conspiracy to have a president removed. But of course, a proper investigation will have to be conducted.\n\nAnd heck, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Petro's goverment may as well be called a really dumb tropical/cocaine Game of Thrones, everyone is blackmailing everyone, backstabbing, plots upon plots, endless bizarre characters trying to court favor with the unstable king in order to advance their own interests. It'd be hilarious if I didn't have to live there."", ""It's very ironic how much Trump and Petro are alike, including how much backstabbing and scheming is in their cabinets, even down to their views of Putin."", 'Umm- are you even from Colombianor actually know someone from there?

Many of the US trading partners are worried that will drive down demand for things made in their countries.\n\nIn the ""Great Deal of Cooperation"", as Trump called it, the US will also impose a steeper tariff of 40% on goods that pass through Vietnam in a process known as ""trans-shipping"".\n\nPeter Navarro, Trump\'s senior counsellor on trade and manufacturing, has said that a third of all Vietnamese exports to the US were actually Chinese products shipped through Vietnam.\n\nThe president said on social media: ""Vietnam will do something that they have never done before, give the United States of America TOTAL ACCESS to their Markets for Trade.\n\n""In other words, they will \'OPEN THEIR MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES,\' meaning that we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.""\n\nVietnam has become a major manufacturing hub for a number of major brands such as Nike, Apple, the Gap and Lululemon. It was a beneficiary of firms moving factories out of China to avoid the tariffs Trump announced during his first term in office.\n\nShare prices of companies making goods in Vietnam initially rose on news of the deal, although those gains were trimmed after it emerged products will still face a 20% tax.\n\nVietnam\'s General Secretary To Lam held a phone call with Trump on Wednesday, during which he reiterated an invitation for the US president to visit the country.\n\nSeparately, the Trump family has recently announced development projects in Vietnam.\nThe country\'s government approved a plan by the Trump Organization and local business Kinh Bac City Development to invest $1.5bn in hotels, golf courses and luxury real estate.\n\nThe Trump Organization is also scouting for locations to build a Trump Tower in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nTrump initially imposed steep levies on trading partners around the world in April , citing a lack of ""reciprocity"", but then announced a pause where they were all lowered to 10%.\n\nMany countries then approached the US to negotiate trade deals, according to the White House.\n\nSince April, Washington had so far only announced a pact with Britain and a deal to temporarily lower retaliatory duties with China.', ""Anytime now Mr trump's heart, those cheeseburgers should do something to you anytime now \n\nJust waiting for THAT headline to appear so I can enjoy a beautiful peaceful day"", 'So Nike, Adidas and Puma gear will all be 20% more.
