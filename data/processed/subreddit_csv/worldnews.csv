With a couple hundred kilometers of ski slopes with direct access - and probably at least five times that in the closer neighborhood - the number of guests every winter was enormous. There was also summer tourism, although it was both in smaller numbers and more physically spread out, which made it far less obvious.\n\nEven back then, every local complained about tourists, but they also had jobs because of them so nobody *really* minded.\n\nOver the decades things changed quite a bit, which is probably why people went from grumbling but happy they had a stable job to annoyed and protesting about it. The reasons for that are manifold, but lets go through the most obvious in no particular order:\n\n*The demographics of workers in the tourism sector*: when I was a kid, a significant share of people who worked directly in tourism-related jobs were locals, or at the very least lived locally. Today, some owners are still locals, but the employees are mostly from eastern Europe who come for their job and leave once the season's over. In other words, of the locals who are annoyed by tourists, fewer and fewer are directly involved in the business and don't feel like tourism is benefiting them. Whether that's true is a different question, but the change is more than obvious.\n\n*The demographics of tourists*: when you look back 40 years at the type of people who spent their vacation skiing in the Alps and compare them to today, thee change is significant. One can't say that après-ski is to blame for everything, but it has definitely expanded as the types of guests changed. In other words, when I was a kid what we saw were a lot more family vacations, whereas today it's late teens and tweens here to party the night away.\n\n*The upswing of mass tourism*: Take any famous tourism location in the world, like the leaning tower of Pisa or just some mountaintop in a small town in the Alps that has an access road rated for a bus. Instead of single families that book hotels or bed & breakfasts locally, suddenly a narrow mountain road is taken over by dozens of buses every day with tourists that are collected from all over the state. They're only here for a half a day, take up space, swarm around like flies and don't even spend their money here.\n\n*The rise of off-season tourism*: when I was a kid, my hometown basically fell asleep or hibernated for months at a time twice every year. After the winter season was over and until the start of the summer season and also the other way around. Today these off-seasons still exist, but instead of hotels or bed & breakfasts closing, they just offer their services at lower rates to attract off-season tourism.\n\n*The (lack of) separation between tourism and residential zones*: AirBnB isn't the sole instigator, but they were certainly to blame for making the concept popular. With tourists entering residential areas more and more, locals often feel that they're being invaded in their safe spaces.\n\nBeing annoyed by tourists is one thing,. but actually doing something about them and going as far as protesting against or attacking them is a level of escalation you don't see unless their reasons are significant enough. I would say, based on first- and secondhand experience that many small and often unique issues build up to create a greater whole.\n\nThe anti-tourism sentiment hasn't been nearly this aggressive in the past, which I can only attribute to local politicians not doing enough to protect locals. Some cities, take Venice for example, mostly get it right, but others are probably too greedy for a few more tourism dollars. It's a simple as that."", 'I’m surprised it took this long. Cities in lower cost countries like Mexico, Portugal and Spain are being overrun with digital nomads and retirees from more expensive countries  relocating to enjoy a cheaper lifestyle. In doing so they are pushing the native people out of the cities since rents, goods, services etc increase astronomically….still not so expensive to the relocating expats but it totally pushes out the native people. While Airbnb is also at fault the real problem is the people relocating long term and taking over neighborhoods. That can be addressed by making it more difficult for non Mexican Nationals to stay in Mexico a long time by more restrictive laws like Spain is doing. This will only stop if the Mexican Government acts or the protests continue and grow which will make the expats feel unwelcome.', 'Should harass govt not tourists( They are paying not taking your money away unlike you know who)', 'The whole world is becoming like this.

The remarks came just hours after Russia’s Foreign Ministry issued a rare public warning, denouncing what it described as efforts to undermine its “strategically important” relationship with Baku.\n\n> Namazov’s proposal is both pointed and deliberate. “A decision should be made to deploy the largest Turkish military base in the region, in Azerbaijan, in the near future,” he said. “For neighbors who do not understand, part of this base would be enough to serve a population of 250 million. It could even be leased to our other ally, the Pakistani Air Force, which possesses nuclear weapons.”\n\n> [...]\n\n> Calls for a Turkish military base in Azerbaijan are not new, and they have never translated into policy. But in the context of the current diplomatic rupture between Baku and Moscow, the conversation carries new symbolic weight.\n\n> For Azerbaijan, invoking the prospect of a deeper Turkish military presence sends a message—both to Russia and to Iran, that it has options. For Moscow, the base debate underscores a more troubling reality: a former ally may no longer be reliably within its sphere of influence.\n\nDoesn't mean much as of right now (Aliyev's shot down rumors about this for a while, though I don't believe he's commented on it since recent events), but the possibility of another NATO base right on Russia's doorstep is pretty hilarious."", 'New threads from ChrisO\\_Wiki\n\n1/ Workers at the giant KAMAZ vehicle plant in Naberezhnye Chelny, Russia, have been banned from bringing in purchased food due to fears of being poisoned by Ukrainians.
