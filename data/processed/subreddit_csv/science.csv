Participants were randomly allocated to follow two diets for 6 weeks each, separated by a minimum 4-week washout period: a high-diversity plant-based diet (HDPD, ≥30 unique plant foods weekly) and a low-diversity plant-based diet (LDPD, ≤15 unique plant foods weekly), alongside a usual kidney diet prescription.

However, there is limited understanding of how different species of pets are associated with these outcomes in different age groups. This study employed a multilevel modelling approach using data from eight waves of the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) to longitudinally examine: (1) the relationship between pet ownership and cognitive decline over 18 years among adults aged 50 and older, (2) The moderating role of younger vs. older age subgroups on this relationship, and (3) the distinct role of owning dogs, cats, birds, and fish. The targeted cognitive domains were executive functioning and episodic memory. Results confirmed that pet ownership is associated with slower decline in both cognitive domains. While age group did not moderate this relationship, differences emerged in the relationship between cognitive decline and individual pet species. **Dog and cat ownership was associated with slower cognitive decline compared to no pet ownership; bird and fish ownership showed no such association.

Neurodivergence has its own stigmas which very much apply to women; as a neurodivergent woman I can safely say that it’s not something you can safely open up to others about and carries different baggage than common mental illnesses.\n\nSecondly, there’s a mountain of evidence that girls mask harder than boys. If there’s ever a topic men can be more open about than women, it’s neurodivergence. Women in this case are way more likely to “bottle up their feelings”.\n\nThat aside, I have a few thoughts about the possible cause of this: \n\n1. It’s less about gender and more about internal symptoms vs external symptoms. If your symptoms of ADHD as a kid is more disruptive to others, others will take notice and may exaggerate your symptoms. Likewise, you may not notice them to the same degree since you’re not the one “bothered” by it. Meanwhile internal symptoms are something you struggle with alone. How many times do we notice when we were an ass vs when we are embarrassed? One is a feeling, the other is an action, it’s easier to keep track of the former.\n\n2. Girls who do get diagnosed get diagnosed because they advocate for themselves, which selects for girls who are introspective. Past histories with medical sexism may also train girls to be critical of their own symptoms, since you have to be more self-reliant and self-advocate more.\n\n3. Girls and boys are socialized differently but it’s more about women being pushed to be more mature and more emotionally intelligent than about “being able to open up more”.', 'I’ve noticed quite uptick in girls vs boys post']","[""Interesting paper.\n\nThe main take away is as the headline says, but another subtle point is that this also suggests adolescent girls have more ADHD symptoms (inattention specifically) than boys (based on self rating and clinician rating but not on parent rating).\n\nThis seems odd to me since conventional wisdom is ADHD is under diagnosed in women and perhaps symptoms are not as well recognised.

In fact, they may be more likely to engage. The research, published in American Politics, finds that individuals with student loan debt are more likely to vote, donate to candidates, and participate in other forms of political action than their counterparts without student loan debt**.\n\nThis finding may seem surprising at first glance. Student loan debt is often discussed in the context of financial stress, economic immobility, and long-term hardship. In the United States, more than 40 million adults collectively owe about $1.8 trillion in student loan debt, a sum that exceeds the nation’s total credit card debt. The rising cost of higher education, paired with stagnant wages and limited avenues for debt relief, has turned the issue into a political flashpoint—particularly for younger Americans and progressive policymakers. But until now, little research had explored how this financial burden shapes political behavior.\n\nAmericans with student loan debt were more likely to vote in presidential elections than those without it. They were also more likely to take part in other electoral behaviors, such as displaying political yard signs, working for a campaign, or donating money to political causes. These results were consistent across two election cycles, across swing states and non-competitive states, and across levels of educational attainment.\n\nThis pattern runs counter to the commonly held belief that economic hardship leads people to disengage from politics. Prior research has shown that unemployment, financial insecurity, and stress can lower rates of political participation. Under this logic, student debt might be expected to sap time, energy, and motivation—making it harder for people to stay politically active. But Macdonald offers a different explanation.\n\nUnlike credit card or medical debt, student loan debt is directly tied to the federal government. Over 90% of student loans are federally held, and the government plays a central role in setting repayment terms, offering deferments, and shaping loan forgiveness programs. Because of this direct connection, individuals may see electoral participation as a pathway to economic relief. In other words, voting or engaging politically could be seen as a practical way to address their financial concerns.\n\nThis reasoning aligns with what scholars call “policy feedback” theory—the idea that people are more likely to become politically active when they are affected by government programs, especially those that are visible and easily attributed to public policy. Just as recipients of Social Security often recognize the government’s role in providing benefits and are motivated to defend them, student loan borrowers may view their debt as a government-controlled burden that can be changed through political action.', 'Yes, allow me to introduce you to the closely-guarded secret of ""young people participate in the process more than other demographics, and are also more likely to still have student loan debt balances.""\n\nThis is the ""you posted a population density map"" of political involvement studies.', 'Correlation doesn’t equal causation.\n\nCould higher education levels, rather than the debt itself, be driving the increased civic participation?\xa0\n\nSeems like kind of a major oversight in the study design.\n\nThe article notes that borrowers with four-year or graduate degrees show higher voter turnout than those who took out loans but didn’t complete college. This suggests education, not debt, might be the key factor—educated individuals often have greater civic knowledge and political efficacy, as the study hints.\n\nThe article challenges the idea that economic hardship reduces political engagement, citing prior research that unemployment and financial insecurity lower participation. But student loan debt isn’t like those hardships. It’s often an investment tied to higher lifetime earnings, not a dead-end burden like unemployment.\xa0\n\nThe study fails to disentangle debt from education level which really weakens its claim that debt *itself* drives engagement.\xa0\n\nIt’s possible, maybe even likely, the debt is just a proxy for being educated.', '>burdened by student loan debt…\ndonate to candidates\n\nMaybe not that one?', 'How’s that compare to the general college educated vs non college educated population?

Women entering the late-reproductive stage and beyond showed marked reductions in these types of anger.\n\nThe only anger measure unaffected by age was suppressed anger—that which is felt but not expressed.\n\nThese findings suggest that as women move through midlife, they may gain greater emotional regulation and resilience—offering a more hopeful narrative around aging and emotional wellbeing.\n\nThe emotional aspects of menopause have often been overlooked, despite their potential impact on both mental and physical health.\n\nAnger and hostility in midlife women have previously been linked to elevated blood pressure, heart disease, and even thicker artery walls—a predictor of atherosclerosis.']",927,137,0.94,Health,1751549307.0

Trying to unlock your car, you fumble and drop the keys. You squat down and run your hand across the invisible pavement. To the left, you feel a firm, rubbery tire. Reversing course, you pass over jagged pebbles and papery leaves. Finally your fingers discover—and instantly close around—a notched piece of metal. This kind of tactile exploration may be the closest we can get to imagining the experience of dolphin echolocation, say the authors of a study on dolphin brains that was recently [published](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323617) in PLOS ONE.\n\nWe typically imagine echolocation as “seeing” with sound—experiencing auditory signals as a world of images like the ones our brains typically create with light from our eyes. Like sonar, which turns sonic waves into visual representations, echolocators emit sounds and then decode spatial and textural information in the echoes that bounce back. And when Russian scientists inserted electrodes into the heads of dolphins and porpoises in the 1970s and 1980s, they reported detecting brain activity in the visual cortex while the animals heard sounds. “It made a neat little story because you have visual and auditory [brain regions] right next to each other,” says Lori Marino, a neuroscientist and president of the Whale Sanctuary Project, who was not an author of the new study but is mentioned in its acknowledgments section. She adds, however, that thanks to today’s more precise technology, “the whole [research] landscape is changing.” Although we still can’t translate echolocation perfectly into human terms, the new findings suggest a better metaphor: “touching” with sound.\n\nDolphin echolocation functions in the brain differently than human echolocation, which, for those who learn the skill, is primarily processed in the visual cortex. To pinpoint the neural mechanisms behind the dolphin variety, the researchers compared preserved brains from three echolocating dolphin species with that of a sei whale, which is closely related but doesn’t echolocate. They measured the diffusion of the movement of water molecules along nerve fibers—like cars along a highway, as Marino puts it—to better understand which parts of the brain interact in living dolphins and in sei whales. Contrary to the earlier Russian research, there seemed to be nothing exceptional occurring in the dolphins’ visual cortex. Instead an entirely different stretch of neural highway caught their attention: the one linking the inferior colliculus to the cerebellum.\n\nIn dolphins, as in humans, the inferior colliculus is a relay point for auditory input after it enters the ear, and the cerebellum is where information from senses and bodily movements gets combined to rapidly calculate the body’s next best move. “Anytime you need to move quickly, decisively, and without consciously deliberating, your cerebellum comes alive,” says Peter Cook, a comparative neuroscientist at the New College of Florida and senior author of the new study. He and his colleagues found a strong connection between these two brain structures in the dolphins but not in the sei whale. So just like touch does in humans, echolocation seems to rely heavily on the cerebellum’s precise motor control and the tight feedback loop it promotes between sensation and motion—and less so on the visual cortex. “Every time you move, you get different feedback,” Cook says. “And every time the feedback changes, you change how you’re moving. It’s like this constant circle of sensory, motor, motor, sensory.”\n\nThis makes sense to lead author Sophie Flem, a master’s student at the New College of Florida. If you need to constantly fine-tune your movements to home in on prey, Flem says, “it does seem intuitive that something like a cerebellum would really help.” And there’s another way in which echolocation seems more like touch than vision: a dolphin’s sonar beam is far narrower than our visual field. Whereas we take in 180 degrees at a glance, dolphins move their beam around and build spatial understanding gradually—like a human groping for dropped keys in the dark. Still, it would be hubris to presume we know for certain what an animal’s echolocation actually feels like. “There may be things other animals do for which there is no model in our sensory system,” Marino says. “We just have to realize that.”', 'i mean, we see with narrow ""beams of"" saccades, brains are funny and the mechanics and sensations of senses are different']","['From the article: It’s midnight in a pitch-dark parking lot.

Their study found:\n\n**96 chemicals were detected in at least five children*+.\n\n**48 chemicals were found in over half of the children**.\n\n**34 chemicals were detected in more than 90% of children** — including nine chemicals not currently tracked in national health surveys like the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\n\n“Our study shows that childhood exposure to potentially harmful chemicals is widespread. This is alarming because we know early childhood is a critical window for brain and body development,” said Deborah H. Bennett, lead author and UC Davis professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences. “**Many of these chemicals are known or suspected to interfere with hormones, brain development and immune function**.”\n\nThe researchers looked for childhood exposure to common environmental chemicals, including:\n\nPhthalates and phthalate alternatives used in plastics like toys and food packaging, as well as personal care products and household items.\n\nParabens commonly used in cosmetics, lotions, shampoos and pharmaceuticals.\n\nBisphenols found in plastic containers, food can linings and thermal paper receipts.\n\nBenzophenones found in sunscreens, cosmetics and plastics.\n\nPesticides used in agricultural and residential pest control.\n\nOrganophosphate esters (OPEs) used as flame retardants in furniture and building materials and as plasticizers in food packaging.\n\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), byproducts of combustion found in vehicle exhaust, grilled foods and tobacco smoke.\n\nBactericides found in antibacterial soaps and personal care products.\n\nChildren are exposed to these environmental chemicals through everyday activities, such as eating, drinking, breathing indoor and outdoor air and touching contaminated surfaces.\n\nFrequent hand-to-mouth contact, playing close to the ground, and higher intake rates relative to their smaller body weight make kids especially vulnerable to chemical exposure.', 'Some of these are normal everyday items. What can you even do to protect against that ?', ""I mean, yeah. We all contain loads of these things to varying degrees. Does it say if they are dangerously high, though? I can't find it."", 'Ok, maybe I missed something, but they simply found the chemicals and then just called it that? If that is the case this makes no sense at all. Of course the chemicals are present they are everywhere, that is not dangerous on its own. It is amount and the concentration that makes something dangerous.\n\nThat and the whole ""There is no safe level of x"" statement is a bit hyperbolic. The actual statement is: ""There is no known threshold below which lead exposure is *guaranteed* to be harmless for all children."" That is a very different statement.\n\nWhy do we have so much rage bait in this forum? People are going to be scared to live in their own skin with all of this pseudoscience info making them paranoid.']",3249,135,0.97,Health,1751450675.0

Uncovering upstream determinants of PA can help identify useful, modifiable targets to increase PA participation. We investigated whether sleep duration and sleep timing were associated with the duration of moderate-to-vigorous PA and overall PA the following day. Results from two independent longitudinal studies showed that both average sleep and nightly changes in sleep are related to PA. Going to sleep earlier than usual may be an effective strategy to maintain normal sleep duration while also optimizing next-day PA.

In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886925002028\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nA new cross-cultural study involving participants from China, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom found that men with a body mass index between 23 and 27 were rated as the most physically attractive. While a shoulder-to-waist ratio around 1.57 was associated with the highest attractiveness, increasing this ratio beyond that point did not significantly enhance ratings. More importantly, the study revealed that **body fat percentage was a stronger and more consistent predictor of attractiveness than either body mass index or shoulder-to-waist ratio**. These findings were published in Personality and Individual Differences.\n\nAdiposity refers to the amount of fat stored in the body and plays a central role in shaping physical appearance. Across many cultures, body fat distribution is closely tied to perceptions of health and fertility. In women, a lower waist-to-hip ratio is often viewed as attractive because it signals reproductive health.\n\nThe findings indicated that men with body mass index values in the mid-20s were rated as the most attractive, aligning closely with the predictions of the evolutionary model. Across all three countries, male bodies with a BMI between 23 and 27 consistently received the highest attractiveness ratings. This range falls within what is typically classified as normal to slightly overweight, suggesting that moderate body mass—rather than extreme leanness or muscularity—is perceived as most desirable.\n\nHowever, the most striking result was the importance of body fat percentage. Across all populations, the relationship between attractiveness and adiposity followed a clear pattern: moderate fat levels were associated with the highest attractiveness ratings, while both very low and very high fat levels were rated less favorably.\n\n**The most attractive male bodies had approximately 13 to 14 percent body fat, a level that corresponds closely with what is considered metabolically healthy**. This pattern held in all three countries, despite cultural and socioeconomic differences between the study populations.', '[removed]', 'Its not the abs that are the main point of attraction for men with low bodyfat, or the body generally.

It's probable that if there is a high bmi, a lower fat percent is desired compared to a low bmi person.\n\nThe researchers can investigate the existing raw data for such signals.

In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886925002028\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nA new cross-cultural study involving participants from China, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom found that men with a body mass index between 23 and 27 were rated as the most physically attractive. While a shoulder-to-waist ratio around 1.57 was associated with the highest attractiveness, increasing this ratio beyond that point did not significantly enhance ratings. More importantly, the study revealed that **body fat percentage was a stronger and more consistent predictor of attractiveness than either body mass index or shoulder-to-waist ratio**. These findings were published in Personality and Individual Differences.\n\nAdiposity refers to the amount of fat stored in the body and plays a central role in shaping physical appearance. Across many cultures, body fat distribution is closely tied to perceptions of health and fertility. In women, a lower waist-to-hip ratio is often viewed as attractive because it signals reproductive health.\n\nThe findings indicated that men with body mass index values in the mid-20s were rated as the most attractive, aligning closely with the predictions of the evolutionary model. Across all three countries, male bodies with a BMI between 23 and 27 consistently received the highest attractiveness ratings. This range falls within what is typically classified as normal to slightly overweight, suggesting that moderate body mass—rather than extreme leanness or muscularity—is perceived as most desirable.\n\nHowever, the most striking result was the importance of body fat percentage. Across all populations, the relationship between attractiveness and adiposity followed a clear pattern: moderate fat levels were associated with the highest attractiveness ratings, while both very low and very high fat levels were rated less favorably.\n\n**The most attractive male bodies had approximately 13 to 14 percent body fat, a level that corresponds closely with what is considered metabolically healthy**. This pattern held in all three countries, despite cultural and socioeconomic differences between the study populations.', '[removed]', '[removed]', 'People find healthy people attractive. what are the odds.']",12857,690,0.95,Psychology,1751390535.0
