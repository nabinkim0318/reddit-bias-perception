1lt2z26,movies,Watching Capone (2020) felt like watching a feature-length version of one of those fake movies they make for real movies....Anyone else feel that way?,"
Weather playing on a TV in a room or showing at a movie theater or even taking a larger role within the actual movie. This felt like a prestige drama that belongs within a satire, where a well-known actor is playing a totally deranged role and everyone in-universe is pretending it’s Oscar-worthy. That’s the exact energy Capone gives off.

It didn’t hit me at first. I started off just kind of baffled, then hit the infamous diarrhea scenes—and that’s when I mentally broke. Not in a “this is bad” way, but in a “wait... this isn’t a real movie, this is a parody of a movie within a movie” kind of way.

After that, I couldn’t unsee it. Tom Hardy isn’t playing Al Capone—he’s playing the role that some fictional actor takes on in a movie about Hollywood excess. You can just feel the scene where the camera pans behind the scenes and he’s like, totally serious about the role and the praise is pouring in.

Once I saw it that way, I weirdly started to appreciate it. I’d never watch it again, but it’s kind of brilliant as a fake movie that accidentally became real. Like an accidental Tropic Thunder moment, just played completely straight.

Do you think they were trolling us?

1lsw2ai,movies,John Carpenter's Memoirs of an Invisible Man starring Chevy Chase... what a strange movie. What went wrong? And who could have been a better lead?,"*Memoirs of an Invisible Man* is such an odd film. There *are* some things that work and it looks great visually (no shock with John Carpenter directing). But tonally, it's a mess.

Chevy Chase seems totally miscast. This was that era where he usually looked like he sleepwalks through roles unless it was a *Vacation* movie. He switches between his usual comedy persona and this weirdly bland, serious version of himself.

His narration is so overwrought too, like it's trying really hard to sell drama but failing miserably.

The character is kind of an idiot. Keeps making mistake after mistake.

There’s one scene that actually made me laugh... when he knocks out a drunk guy to steal his cab. That moment felt like the *real* Chevy Chase. But the rest of the movie plays it so straight it’s almost uncomfortable.

It’s like Chase was trying to make a comedy while Carpenter was directing a straight-up paranoid thriller.

It reminded me of the behind-the-scenes tension on *Vampire in Brooklyn:* Eddie Murphy wanted to be serious, Wes Craven wanted to make it horror comedy, and neither tone won.

I wouldn’t be surprised if *Memoirs* had a bunch of reshoots or rewrites. It definitely feels like it didn’t know what it wanted to be.

Honestly, I think another actor, someone younger and more energetic could have made it work better and played more in sync with Carpenter.

Curious what others think. Anyone actually like this movie? Or know more about what went on behind the scenes?","['So I\'m trying to remember the whole story, but basically John Carpenter had no control on this.

I just watched black swan for the first time and I FREAKING LOVED IT. But I’m curious if there is a definite answer of what mental issues Nina is struggling with. I’ve recently watched some videos in which DID was thoroughly explained and I thought that’s what it was. I mean at some point Lily is made Nina’s “alternate” which from my understanding is what the personalities of someone with DID are called. And also I learned that alternates are commonly created as a result of trauma. So when Nina is talking to Thomas and says “You made her my alternate”, I thought that was a double meaning where the stress of changing for the role caused her to have this new alternate.

I also considered that she had schizophrenia as well because I wasn’t sure if most people with DID have alternates based off of real people. So like she has this alternate that she sees and talks to because of her DID, but the schizophrenia also makes her hallucinate that the alternate is Lily.

But again this is just what I thought when I was watching it and I’d love to know what others thought or if there are any absolute answers from psychologists. Thanks!","[""Great movie, isn't it!

I know it would depend on a lot of factors, like amount of staff, or how much cgi live action movies would have, time given for project etc.

(This goes for more average production value hollywood movies, not extreme 200 dollar movies, but also not low budget films)

I would assume animation is more expensive for even slightly big movies.

At the time it was one of, or the most expensive film ever made iirc. All the stunt and in-camera effects etc.\n\nAnimation has also had a tonne of evolution. Once upon a time you needed talented, skilled artists to handcraft every single individual fuckin frame of footage. Not to diminish later animator talent or skill, tech has allowed a far easier go of it in that regard, doing CG animation. But in saying that, there's a whole other set of challenges there too.\n\nBut consider how there's high level, cinematic and/or very artistic animation compared to the kind of cheap and cheerful animation you see in low end kids shows etc. One is probably a result of sought after designers, concept artists, animation studios, creative visionary types. The other can be pumped out like an assembly line.\n\n(Not saying all kids stuff is like that, just that I've seen a lot of what looks like super low budget stuff.

They all run out the same door and enter the “world” of Northern California. How can they just expect us to believe that:

A. Humans can’t catch most of them if not all with our full military capabilities?

B. That this is a global issue? Like how fast can dinosaurs all starting in northern CA, mostly land animals, scale the continents and wreak havoc before being contained, etc?

It’d take generations before they can procreate and grow populations. Seems wild to base the whole ending off this. That dinosaurs are just going to be a part of the world’s ecosystem now that 20 of them are on the loose in Redding, CA.

1lsrsmb,movies,The Cornetto Trilogy,"Hi All

Shaun of the Dead 🔴,Hot Fuzz 🔵,and Worlds End 🟢 are all part of the Cornetto trilogy that are all connected by Cornetto.

I enjoy this trilogy especially since Edgar Wright took inspiration from the Color Trilogy which I need to rewatch again because they’re fantastic films. All 3 films have their moments and it’s just so hard to find a favorite yet I know which one is the best.

Worlds End is the best one from the trilogy for simply being the most compelling and maturing quality of the film where everything comes together so hands down Worlds End is the best one yet Shaun of the End or Hot Fuzz are competing for my favorite spot because one is a modernized version of a zombie film in Shaun and a satire yet action filled cop film in Hot Fuzz.

I just enjoy the whole trilogy but what’s your opinion on the cornetto trilogy and do you have a favorite one?

This is analytical and is based on sampling theory and probability. This is not subjective analysis. These are not based on my opinions.

Here is the de-biased score for Marvel films/streaming shows since 2008. I have NOT scaled for the increasing frequency of bias but I don't think that would change this.

1lso72l,movies,Recommendations for Robot Movies?,"I've been doing a self-imposed challenge this year. Every Monday, I watch a different Nicolas Cage film. I'm halfway through the year now, and I'm loving it! Forcing myself to watch a thing I otherwise might not ever touch has forced me out of my normal film taste, and having such a defined structure has been a way to keep myself going through it.

With that said, I want to do it again in 2026 with a new theme. Nicolas Cage has been a great subject, but has some limitations. A lot of his work can be pretty samey, and basically everything is feature-length. Sometimes finding an entire 90 minutes on a Monday is super difficult, and I want to give myself some leeway.

So I'm trying to do robots next year. Anything robots. I thought asking people here would be better than just googling and making a list on my own. All recommendations will go into a list on Letterboxd for myself so I can pick through it through the year.

Requirements:

⚪ The movie has to have a robot in it. It doesn't have to be a starring role. It can even just be one scene. But preferably, the robot would have some significance to the themes of the film.

⚪ A robot can be a lot of different things, but it needs to have some sense of humanity. Blade Runner counts. Transformers counts. Even Interstellar counts. Sonic the Hedgehog (with the little drone robots) doesn't count.

⚪ Short films and documentaries are a plus, to space out normal feature films.

⚪ Bad movies are awesome! Like I said, I'm watching Nic Cage movies this year. My tolerance for bad movies is pretty high.

⚪ It needs to have a Letterboxd entry. Sorry, that's just how I track my movie habits. If it's not on Letterboxd, I may still watch it, but it won't be part of this.

So, what do you recommend?","['Ex Machina', '# Short Circuit\n\n# Short Circuit 2', 'Batteries not included', 'Bicentennial Man', ""The Wild Robot.

1lso00g,movies,In defense of Rotten Tomatoes,"Rotten Tomatoes gets clowned on a lot. And I somewhat get it. Because a 90% doesn’t mean critics on average give it a 9/10, just that 90% of critics liked it well enough to give it a positive recommendation.

Now there are exceptions, but for me that binary system actually works really well for me determining if I’m going to enjoy a film or not. It’s not a predictor of the degree to which I’ll enjoy a film, but it’s a powerful predictor as to the likelihood I’ll enjoy a movie.

Like I’ll see basically anything with 90+% score and be guaranteed I’ll basically like it, even if the film wasn’t on my radar. It’s also a good guarantee that my friends and/or dates will like it, because ultimately the tomato score is an arbiter of broad appeal.

Ironically my favorite films tend to have a slightly lower RT film, just because usually to become a favorite, it has to do something really distinctive and have a strong POV from the film maker, which usually means it’s a bit more divisive. But those usually end up at arthouse theaters and I let those theaters generally curate for me.

So basically when it comes to broad appeal movies in non arthouse theaters, RT is pretty powerful predictor IMO in a way that a simply aggregated score isn’t ","[""If you're able to watch a lot of movies and are trying to decide whether a movie is worth watching, it can be very useful.\n\nIf you're not able to see every movie you want to see and you're trying to decide *which* movie to watch out of several possibilities, it's not the right tool for that job"", 'Because they\'ve reduced actual movie criticism to a number.

1lskla4,movies,What are some other big budget but experimental films?,"TL;Dr - what major releases or big-budget films essentially are experimental films in disguise?

----

I went to school in Boulder, and I was lucky enough to do a little film School under Bruce Kawin, but the real point is that I sold Stan Brakhage cigarettes at Jones drug on the hill and I got to talk to him a lot. It was really rewarding, and it gave me a fascinating insight to experimental filmmaking that I hadn't considered prior to meeting him or having a little film theory injected into my brain.

So I'm obviously not talking about moth light or really niche experimental filmmaking. But rather, what are some big budget films that essentially act like Blockbusters or big releases that are truly doing something experimental?

Namely, Interstellar with the sound design, or Warfare by Alex Garland as an experiment in memory versus objective reality. I am endlessly fascinated by the latter film.

Alex Garland worked with a Marine to present what essentially is a nonfiction autobiographical retelling of a short battle in Iraq. So Warfare is a study in the malleability of memory in context of talking to all the Marines and trying to piece together the literal nonfiction objective reality account, and they still ran into impossibly complex contradictions where you could objectively know they misremembered things. It's a fascinating experiment in filmmaking. It is neither a rah rah pro-America pro-War film nor is it a anti War film. It's almost like Michael Heneke, forcing the audience to do the work themselves. Any objective observer would easily review the nonfiction account and arrive at their own conclusion.

So what are other major or large or big budget releases that were essentially experimental in nature in some manner or regard?","['**2001: A Space Odyssey** is an epic Hollywood Art Film.', 'Megalopolis, lol.', 'Charlie Kaufman movies are usually well funded and pretty out there conceptually. \n\nBeing John Malkovich is a prime example.', 'Monkeybone.\n\nLive action/Stop motion Movie with Brendan Fraser.

Has hit movies across genres: action, (The Nice Guys), comedy (The Big Short-a comedic role at least), romcom (Crazy, Stupid, Love), blockbuster, (Barbie), scifi (Blade Runner), thriller (Drive), romance (The Notebook), quirky (Lars and The Real Girl), artsy (Blue Valentine, The Place Beyond the Pines), musical (La La Land)

\- No duds or bad performances.

\- Little to no controversy surrounding him.

\- Popular with both men and women.

\- Not oversaturated by being in a shit load of ads or podcasts or media stunts.

\- Respected in pop culture: memes, things like SNL appearances, interviews.

\- Was sometimes mocked for understated performances like Drive early in his career but that seems to have faded with a wide range of performances.

**Other candidates:**

Leo - Wins on resume and range but not popular with women who can't stand his dating preferences.

Pitt - Also wins on resume, has similar range, more controversial reputation.

Cruise - Biggest movie star for a long time, has the most hits but a long list of controversial lifestyle choices.

Reeves - Possibly most beloved movie star on the internet but questionable range.

Reynolds - Maybe held the crown for a brief time but became oversaturated and doesn't have much range.

These are off the top of my head, obviously there are other candidates.

  * [The Terminator II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvA6TkYuQP8) - Your foster parents are dead

1lsfvgt,movies,Why I think Brad Pitt is a cooler / better star than Tom Cruise?,"Below views are my opinion, no offense to anyone.

I'm not saying this just after watching F1 - it's something I've always felt and F1 just reinforced that idea.


**Tom Cruise** \- Always has this 'I know I am amazing' kind of egoistic-proud look on his face at all times - I mean even on-screen over the past few (7-8) years including recent MI movies.

Sure, he may have had that 'innocence' in his younger days in films like Vanilla Sky, Minority Report etc.But not these days. The ego, the fame has gotten to his head but more importantly it SHOWS on his face and persona. Same thing with DiCaprio.


But here's where our man is different:

**Brad Pitt** \- From a film back in the day like 7 years in Tibet - till today in OUATIH or F1, Pitt's face still has a certain 'vulnerability' - it doesn't scream 'yo I'm a rich superstar and know everything' , there's a certain 'I've gone through a lot of struggle to get here and there's a lot  beneath this cool exterior and swag' kinda thing about him.

That's why when he plays roles like F1 where 'he was once a successful dude who lost everything and is now having a second chance to prove himself' - we feel that emotion and root for him as his eyes, his wrinkles convey a certain level of that 'pain'.

And most of the world isn't rich - most of the world are people 'trying' to succeeed and get better and have many struggles to deal with. So a story + actor/role that embodies that feeling is always likely to hit home!

1lseqga,movies,Something surreal happened to me today — watched Oldboy on July 5th,"
So today (July 5th), I randomly decided to watch *Oldboy* (the original 2003 Korean film). I’ve been putting it off forever, always telling myself I’d watch it *some day*.

No particular reason why today — just felt like finally seeing what the hype was about.

Turns out (major spoiler if you haven’t seen it) **the entire climax of the movie revolves around July 5th.** It’s literally the date on the calendar that triggers the big reveal.

I had absolutely no idea about this going in. It was just a total coincidence. Watching that scene *today* gave me actual chills.

What’s even weirder is this isn’t the first time something like this has happened to me. I’ve had a few strangely timed experiences where I watched or read something at the exact date it references, or learned something that suddenly became hyper-relevant.

Not sure why, but little moments like this feel almost supernatural. Like life has weird glitches or winks that line up just right.

Anyone else ever experience oddly timed coincidences like this? Would love to hear your stories.

1lse8uf,movies,"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) is one those films that while influential, bears little resemblance to the movies it inspired.","The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (sic) was shot in a month during a heat-wave on a budget of nothing. For a grindhouse horror film there isn't that much visible blood, nor is there any nudity. The director Tobe Hooper was honestly banking on the film earning a PG rating at the time. It got an R, but also made turned a profit thirty times over. The cast was made up of locals, and it was filmed around three buildings, a graveyard, and inside a van.

Massacre is one of those interesting films because, while it inspired later slasher films, the movie itself had no rulebook to follow. The plot and script is thin, more a disturbing trip than anything. There are five main characters and I couldn't tell you their names except for the annoying guy in a wheelchair, Franklin. Apparently his actor stayed in character between filming, which pissed off the rest of the cast and crew. It may reflect badly on me finding it a relief when Leatherface carves a defenceless man in wheelchair like a Christmas turkey, but I'll take what I'm given.

Four of the five leads are killed in quick succession in the middle act, having no idea they're in a horror-movie until it's too late. We don't know them too well, and they don't fit any archetypes. They're not characters, more just random people. Aside from an encounter with a creepy hitchhiker and a spot of grave-robbing I was surprised at how normal the first act of the movie is compared the depravity of the last.

When I saw the excellent **Sinners** there was only scene I thought was superfluous and that's the first one. It's a flash-forward depicting one of the survivors after the main event and we briefly get a glimpse of the vampires. This felt like a pointless concession as the actual first scene properly establishes the same character, while the vampires don't appear until the first act is over, a la **From Dusk til Dawn**.

Here, Leatherface is interesting as a villain because he comes absolutely out of nowhere. There's no scare chord, no POV shot of him at his work, no prior hint to his existence. Thirty-five minutes into the movie a guy walks into a country house in the afternoon, and then he's bludgeoned to death by a giant butcher wearing a flayed face as a mask.

Leatherface isn't the sole villain either. Instead he's just the pitiable son or brother in a family of cannibals, incapable of communicating normally. None of the villains are named, nor are they invincible. One of them gets run over in the street, and Leatherface gets belted in the face with a wrench. I find it  interesting when antagonists in horror movies experience their own setbacks. Unless they're a zombie or explicitly supernatural, they should suffer the occasional pratfall. While the family may bicker and act camp, the film itself never wavers from its gritty and bleak tone.

There's a lot of aspects to the film's production that obviously shouldn't be replicated. They used a live chainsaw which almost killed Leatherface's actor on more than one occasion. The leading lady was thrown out a window and had her finger cut and sucked by another actor. The crew also spent entire days filming the dining-room scene, having to contend with the heatwave and long-spoiled food. Pretty much nobody had to act in the deranged climax

Massacre is an 80 minute-film about a gang of hapless young adults getting carved up by cannibals. Where it a better movie it'd be considerably worse. Had the camerawork been more elaborate, the acting more professional, and the special-effects like the old-man mask been of higher quality, the results would have been less interesting. You need a considerable budget if you're depicting a shapeshifting alien in the Antarctic, or having a housefly transform into Jeff Goldblum. But for a minor bloodbath in Texas the raw and unpolished feel is the film's best aspect. The director's own sequel was a black comedy, while every other follow-up just kind of existed. The last one made jabs at millennials for some reason.

While it may not be worth trying to recapture the lightning in a bottle, given how many of the sequels flopped, I think the method of Massacre is still fertile for horror. By shooting the horror like a straight documentary instead of a lavish Hollywood film, you make the viewer feel like an uncomfortable witness instead of a safe audience. The horror can happen in the middle of the day with zero warning in a local neighbourhood. The soundtrack can be either absent or come across as utterly maumed, and maybe pay John Larroquette in weed to do the opening narration again.","['Black Christmas really started the slasher genre imo. \n\nTexas chainsaw helped but it was much different. \n\nThe films I think resemble Texas chainsaw more are going to be the grainy horrors like \n\n-the devils rejects / 1000 corpses \n\n- hills have eyes\n\n- X\n\nAnd like you said the budget and disgust of filming in that Texas heatwave will never be replicated so it is hard to see that on screen.', ""Great read and completely agree, it has been said by many before including myself but it really captured this feeling of watching something that you're not meant to be watching and still holds up."", 'As muddled as it is, I legit think Texas Chainsaw 4, with McConaughey, has merit.\n\nIt isn\'t nowhere near the masterpiece of insanity as the original, but as a send-up and fuck you to 90s horror, it\'s interesting.\n\nThe family has been neutered...no longer cannibals and instead are pizza loving goofs who fall into cult/conspiracy theory groups.

1lsdoni,movies,In defense of Rebel Moon,"I've just finished the two directors' cut versions of the rebel moon movies and, with a few exceptions, really loved them. I haven't seen the previous versions. For the record I don't give a shit about Zack Snyder, I never really liked any of these movies, even his first ones.



I'll take a scene at the beginning of the second film to explain why I really liked them, I'll keep it vague so as not to spoil it. In the first third of Rebel Moon part 2, there's a surprise assassination scene on a ship. Some people arrive, thinking they're inaugurating the ship, and everyone gets killed. A string quartet in the corner accompanies the scene, surprisingly adapting what they're playing to what's happening in front of them. The whole thing is, of course, full of slow motion and superfluous effect. And I loved this scene as much as I loved the film, because Snyder and the people around him weren't afraid to be absolutely grandiloquent and ridiculous, taking themselves very seriously to make something epic, in the literal sense of the word, something with big feelings, melodrama, very nasty villains and ultra-heroic heroes. And with the prevalence of Marvelization of films (compare Old Guard to its sequel, for example) where everything is a joke and nothing is to be taken seriously, well, it's good to see something where they’re not afraid of being ridiculous. It's absolutely dramatic in the best sense of the word, and it's good to see that kind of thing. 



I even liked the harvest scene, it was beautiful.



So yes, I know symbolism is the most in-your-face symbolism in the world, the action scenes are based on the rule of cool rather than common sense (thank you General Titus for your strategy of making a bunch of peasants run screaming rather than hiding in buildings to snipe at the bad guys), and the visual effects are so present that some scenes are 50% random fireflies, but that's it, it's a pleasure to see, the actors are all beautiful, the robot Jimmy has an incredible design and it's Anthony Hopkins who tells poetry, it's the kind of work that also makes me have big emotions.



Yes, it's very cheesy and grandiloquent, yes there's a lot of slow motion and everything is enormously produced, but we're entitled to say that it's cool and that sometimes it's good when things are cool. Slow motion isn't bad in itself, and here it's used to create tableaux, to say “look how classy this thing is”, and while I understand that some may find it tiresome, I got a real kick out of it. Yes, it's not Macbeth, but it's grandiose and I found that enjoyable. Rebel Moon is the 7 Samurai in the Warhammer 40k universe, with fireflies everywhere. 



I really hope to have more of it, I want to keep experiencing this universe.

He and Robert Downey Jr had similar career. Had a parent in movie industry so got early chances. Got into big banners at a young age but then lost it all due to drugs, booze and sex..

Both had a comeback with iron man and two and a half men but charlie spoiled it again..

But charlie sheen had been part of major movies like platoon, wall street , red dawn etc until he broke off with oliver stone..

What would have been his career ? Would he had a career like tom cruise, Johny depp, brad pitt etc or still fizzled out due to his shortcomings??

Most of Tuco's backstabbing's were in response to something Blondie did first, or after the cycle of trust had been broken. Is it because Clint Eastwood is cool?

1ls8c50,movies,The StormPAR Subplot in Twisters (2024) Makes Absolutely No Sense,"So it's revealed that StormPAR is tracking these tornados at the behest of a nefarious profiteer, Marshall Riggs, who is otherwise funding their science. He's using their knowledge of where a tornado has recently hit to go and buy up the survivor's land for cheap.

**Except that information is useless,** because everyone already knows if a town has been wiped out by a tornado, because it's immediately in the news. Shared on social media. Just _freely_ published in weather reporting data online.

Spending (presumably) tens of millions to know potentially minutes quicker is of absolutely no benefit. It's like hiring someone to let you know if your house has burned down, you'll already fucking know!

---

1ls6zmf,movies,Did somebody watched this polish horror movie?,"The movie name is Wieczny Strach. It's about The Death itself, who betrayed her creator, Satan and escaped from hell. Now, after few years, Devil sends 10 of his angels to find, and kill even death. If they die, or come back without death, he will open the gates of hell, and start biblical event, called The Judgement Day. But there will be no god to stop him, only The end itself.

I SENT LINK TO THIS FILM, SO IF SOMEONE IS INTERESTED THEY CAN WATCH.

So, the movie is made by 3 15-yo people. YES. not only this, but at some moment it gets so fucking intense just from the soundtrack. It's not a normal horror movie, since it's telling a story that is not being filmed by cameras or whatever, but has animations, and clips, showing The Devil, Death, (SPOILER - The Angel of Truth  ) and fallen angels. Sadly, it has no English subtitles, so if you don't understand polish language, you will not understand what is going on.
For me, very underrated horror film that has elements I don't think a lot of people ever saw in a horror movie.
Also, film's color palette choice is great. Only colors are white, grey, black and.. red, that appears only when Satan, or fallen angels show up.

1ls2dvf,movies,What's a Movie you Love that isn't widely popular?,"As the question asks, I wanted to know if anyone else has a story like mine. For me, the choice was a toss-up between Daredevil starring Ben Affleck and Atlantis: The Lost Empire. After thinking it over, I have to give it to Atlantis. I loved that film for everything it was and what it represented to me.

I saw it in theaters with someone very important to me, someone who has since passed away. To this day, I can't watch it without tearing up a little. I remember that person, of course, but I also find myself marveling at how much I still love the characters, the world, and the experience. I often wonder when the last time was that I felt so deeply immersed in a Disney animated film.

I can’t speak for anyone else, but that theater experience was unforgettable. As a kid, I couldn’t wrap my head around how they pulled off the animation, the angles, the sense of movement, the way it felt like we were surfacing through water. It was stunning.

And to add another layer, the person I saw it with was a big fan of Jim Varney, who voiced a character in the film. Atlantis was his final role, which made it all the more meaningful.

So, what about you? What film holds a special place in your heart, and why? I’d love to hear your stories. Hopefully, this discussion helps us all reconnect with the love of film and those unusual gems that manage to capture our hearts.","[""Atlantis: The Lost Empire is the type of movie that Disney should be doing Live Action reboots of.

1ls23ox,movies,ID4,"Mandatory rewatching, my (half baked, moronic, and otherwise) observations

- Russell Case is a god damn American Icon in this household. There was a post the other day about movies that hit different as a parent, this is definitely one of them. Both Case and Whitmore, and to a lesser extent Vivica A Fox, they just come across differently, as great parents. On that note...there have been multi-mile wide alien space ships hovering over American cities for a day, they have obliterated New York, DC, LA, Atlanta, and others...you are literally about to send a squadron of volunteer amateur pilots to fight them...why is the god damn Colonel from Area 51 giving Russell side eye when he tells them he was abducted by aliens 10 years ago?

- President Whitmore ""I have a beautiful, young, brunette in bed with me"". His wife ""Her!?!"" Once you see that its Mae Whitman, your eyes lock onto her everytime just expecting her to do something quirky and cute like make a mayonegg.

- Dr Oakenshits or whatever is wildly irresponsible. They have this ship and 3 cadavers for 40 years, and Whitmore is right - they've done absolutely nothing and learned even less about them in that time. Then, he gets a new subject, who's merely unconscious (confirmed, not dead) and does a casual autopsy with little more that a face mask for protection. The same aliens who were wiping them out without breaking a sweat. THERE WERE ROBOTS IN 1996, IM SURE THEY HAD SOME AT AREA FUCKING 51. The part i don't see get mentioned much is how...advanced that alien is. Pay attention and you'll see he's manipulating Oakenshits voice box, forcing him to talk (way back I just assumed it was the telepathy they referenced earlier).

- Vivicas titanic thunder thigh problem. So, i dont have the math, but stay with me. This gigantic warship, that is several miles wide, produces a beam of pure energy that wipes out a 1,000 foot tall building in an instant. This strike produces a concussive blast that wipes out the entirety of New York City and greater Los Angeles (or at least what looks to be several miles wide radii). Viv sees this happening from her car, struggles out of the seat, throws a few bags out the back seat, grabs her son, and is able to run 50 yards or so, kick open a maintenance door, all in time to not just avoid the concussive blast, but call to the dog. The dog I can get...but Will Smith literally calls her ""chicken legs"" earlier in the film.

- This kid man...he's going through the rubble in the background, picking up random toys and collecting them. How far away are the kids who used to own them? He does this repeatedly in quick glances. THESE ARE NOT HIS TOYS, those were in the car that was obliterated.

- Where did the dog shit? It's not an inconsequential question. Think about how dogs react to fireworks. This dog was in the middle of a nuclear alien assault, then transported to Area 51. He clearly wouldn't have been allowed outside during the attack. Did they just...put him in with the now-dead alien?

- Think youve had a bad day? Imagine how many supervisors were crawling up that alien longshoremans ass after he tractor beamed in a foreign craft that hadnt been seen in 40 years and then a virus was detected coming from his quadrant (well, prior to having a several ton warhead fired up his ass). We see a supervisor literally coming to check in on him (and presumably be the 20th person give him shit about his mistake) as the warhead goes off.

- So, Whitmore...he was a Gulf War pilot. Clearly, the Uber ecohippie who suckerpunched him didnt vote for him. Vivica (a low income stripper with a heart of gold single mother) says she ""voted for the other guy""...just *how* upset would he have been that New York and LA were obliterated...California and New York are now swing states (im ignoring ID4.2)

- The random guy in the Harley hat, who's part of the volunteer airmen. The camera has him just off center constantly, he's high fiving, he's almost in focus. And yet... he gets 0 lines and is one of our key identifiers of that group. Comes across weird to me, like they wanted him to be distinct, but didnt have anything for him to do.

1lrzk70,movies,"What are some movies that as you got older, you go back to and have a very different experience? Groundhog Day for me for sure.","Gotta say, when I first saw Groundhog Day, I thought it was just this dumb, funny movie. Bill Murray stuck in some miserable town, surrounded by annoying people and his coworkers like Chris Elliott and random locals who just wouldn’t leave him alone. I mean, even I was annoyed by Stephen Tobolowsky. But that was the joke, right? You watched it for Bill's facial expressions as he gets tortured by the same day over and over again. That was the whole appeal, it was funny.

But then you get older, and suddenly you're like, Whoa. That’s life, man. Yeah it's funny but it's also absurd and kind of sad.

The movie’s actually...kind of deep when you watch it when you're older. Cause you realize real life is surprisingly repetitive. There are days you wake up and feel exactly like Bill Murray—trapped in the same job, having the same small talk with the same people you secretly can’t stand. And you just want out. Suddenly, those suicide scenes? Not so funny anymore.

Bill isn’t just this smug, narcissistic jerk getting what he deserves. Well... he kind of is. But then you start to realize so are you. You think you're better than everyone around you. That you're destined for more. That this isn't the life you were meant to live.

Okay, maybe that’s just me.

Maybe you guys all got your lives together and you’re mature and selfless. Not me though and honestly, I kind of hate how relatable the movie has become.

Have you ever had that experience with a movie?

Not just discovering it’s deeper than you remembered, but realizing it hits totally differently now? LIke you finally caught all the dirty jokes you missed as a kid. Or you rewatched something you loved and thought, Wow, this is way weirder than I remember. Or like a friend of mine once said that a movie her cherished and thought was profound turns out it was really dumb.

It felt like an incredibly unique window into some form of Northern Britain in the 1980s, but I don't think I quite understood the tone of the movie a lot of the time.

It deals with so many things that, especially from the lens of a totally modern viewer, many of us would see as hugely problematic, dysfunctional, even traumatic, but every time I was starting to feel like the movie was settling into being a critique of these things, perhaps as the grim consequences start to pile up, it then hits you with a moment of levity that seems to slightly disrespect the severity of the issues at hand. Perhaps the ending of the movie being so wacky has retroactively made me feel less certain about the tone of the rest of it...

In a weird way, it actually reminded me a bit of 'Heathers', the original movie (1989), but watching Rita, Sue and Bob Too made me miss the straightforwardness of Heathers' satire in the sense that I never doubted the writers were showing us a bunch of horrible shit, even if it was presented in a funny way, and even if we were supposed to sympathise with why people end up cunts.

In Rita, Sue and Bob Too, I just couldn't quite tell if the movie was sometimes pulling its punches on how damning to be about some heinous act. And don't get me wrong, I'd consider myself pretty sort of 'sex positive' if that's the right way to describe it, and I actually thought that was a great angle in the movie overall, but surely even in 1987 (release date of movie) you'd expect the older dude in this movie to catch some serious flack in his closing scene, not just get a goofy 'oh what are men like?! hahaaa' ending.

1lrxnup,movies,I have seen every Liam Neeson action movie and ranked them.,"I enjoy Liam Neeson action movies because he doesn't just phone it in like other older action stars making action movies. They have a decent plot, well shot, and his acting is always good. The action is mostly well done, but some have a lot of cuts and bad editing. I will rate them in order of: 1: Action. 2: Story. 3: Everything else.

I'm only ranking pure action movies, and he has to be the **main protagonist**.



1. **Taken** - The one that started it all and still the best one. Great story and action.

2. **Run All Night** - One of his best when it comes to pure action, and the plot is interesting with some twists.

3. **Non-Stop** - Pure adrenaline, set on an Airplane, intriguing plot and twists.

4. **Unknown** - Another one with great plot and twists. Action movie with mystery.

5. **Darkman** - This is an underrated movie, it's a comic book adaptation, but I'll count it as an action movie.

6.  **A Walk Among the Tombstones** - Detective movie with action and good story.

7. **The Commuter** - Similar to Non-Stop but set on a train and just a fun movie.

8. **Honest Thief** - Liam Neeson doing what he does best. Not bad.

9. **Cold Pursuit** - Different from his other action movies, but a funny action movie with dark humor.

10. **The Marksman** - Liam Neeson against the cartel, say no more.

11. **Memory** - Generic action movie, not much to say.

12. **Taken 2** - Disappointing sequel compared to original.

13. **The Ice Road** - Not a bad movie, but it's more of a disaster movie with some action.

14. **Retribution** - Below average. The whole movie takes place in a car, with some twists, and can be boring.

15. **Absolution** - Yea this is one of his worst action movie, bad plot, bad acting, only little action scenes.

16. **Blacklight** - Literally unwatchable trash with boring plot, avoid it. How did this cost 40m??

17. **Taken 3** - Just for the fence scene, this deserves last place.","['The fence scene! They paid for those cameras and they were going to make sure they used them all!

1lrw721,movies,Possession (1981) is an absolutely batshit insane movie - I'm still not sure how I really feel about it,"Just finished this 1980s horror cult classic and holy shit bruh...this movie is the definition of ""wtf did I just watch?"". Just an absolutely bonkers, over-the-top story that's equal parts genius and ridiculous.

It took me a little bit of time to really latch on to the narrative, because it's so purposefully heightened and melodramatic. The dizzying camerawork, the unhinged, overacted performances and the gradually escalating luridness creates a truly demented and nightmarish atmosphere. Honestly, it's worth watching for pure vibes alone.

Isabelle Adjani is what everyone talks about when mentioning Possession, and I think her performance mostly lives up to the hype. It's just complete commitment to the role, no holds barred. The infamous subway scene is as wild and jaw-dropping as advertised. Sam Neill deserves a lot of credit too, for playing a character almost as fucking nutty as his wife. His portrayal of a man seeing his marriage fall apart and realizing he has no control over it is pretty damn impressive.

In fact, the first thing that I thought of when I finished it is that Andrzej Zulawski was definitely fuckin' going through it. The entire narrative felt like a representation of a man experiencing the end of his marriage, not being able to come to terms with it and desperately doing whatever he can to hold on to a relationship that's already over and beyond repair. To that end, the ending, >!with the creature turning into a ""better"" version of Mark, seems to indicate that he's been well and truly replaced!<

Really, the horror element is surprisingly almost a sidenote - I was expecting the movie to have much more straight-up horror-esque elements than it actually did. This isn't bad really, just unexpected. The squid monster thing seems almost symbolic a lot of the time.

In terms of why I'm conflicted about the movie...even though I found it fun, well-made and something I'll probably remember for a while, the extremely heightened nature of the story and the atmosphere is a *lot* to take. The entire movie is one giant crash-out, everybody speaks like they're in a mental institution, there's sooo much screaming and yelling, and unless you remind yourself that it's purposefully designed to be absurd, the campy overacting can be grating and unintentionally hilarious.

With that being said - this is a truly unique cinematic experience. It really feels like a waking nightmare and it never stops making you feel uncomfortable - which is really what the best horror movies manage to achieve.

Apparently there's a remake in the works, which to me seems like an awful idea. The untethered, no-limit insanity of this movie is what makes it work and I really can't see a modern remake capturing the tone - or a modern actress embodying what Isabelle Adjani pulled off.

Watched The Godfather today for the who knows how many times.  Always thought that it was a bad call for Don Corleone to send his most faithful to Sollozzo under the guise that he was unhappy with the family.

Corleone seemed unmoved about Brasi’s awkward thanks at the wedding. Almost disgusted.

Was it a test to see what Sollozzo would do? Was Brasi expendable?

1lrt03x,movies,Aesthetically Pleasing Movies,"Have you ever ended up liking a film (perhaps more than you typically would) just because of the way it looks and its style? Or maybe it's a good film but the visuals really enhance it or standout - e.g. the cinematography, set design or even certain camera angles/shots.

Here's some of my random ones:

- Constantine (2005) starring Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz. I love this movie because the whole thing looks like it happens at night (even during the daytime scenes). Some camera angles are straight out of a comic book and the colouring is good too. I think during the directors commentary they said it was purposely coloured with browns and reds to look like the pits of hell.

An obvious one:

- Sin City (2005) starring Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba. All in black and white with only a few tinges of colour. Very cool effect. The Spirit (2008) uses a similar effect, however isn't considered as good a film.

An obscure one:

- I Am Vengeance (2018) starring Wade Barrett and Anna Shaffer. Not particularly a great film (by reviews) but I love it because of the cool camera angles, shadows and shots of the GTO car. It's like a throwback to those 80s/90s action films.

A modern one:

- The Batman (2022) starting Robert Pattinson and Zoe Kravitz. A really great take on Gotham City and the look of the film gives great underbelly waiting to combust vibes.

I sit here with tears in my eyes. Watched the Saga a few times and they absolute nailed the Sequel after DECADES.
2005 when they told me its coming a new Rocky Movie it said myself i cant be succesful, it must be a flop.

1lrrt85,movies,Is a critically acclaimed Dinosaur movie possible post Jurassic Park?,"After getting to see Jurassic World:Rebirth last week and seeing the reaction prior to release, this question has been on my mind. As a big fan Of Gareth Edwards and his work, especially Godzilla (2014), I was a bit saddened to see the general reaction of critics to Rebirth, as I had a lot of hope that it would be at least somewhat well received.

Before we get into a massive Argument about how “critic reviews don’t matter” and “only the Audience matters”. I totally understand where people are coming from, and there are PLENTY of films that I love personally that were absolutely shit on by critics.But I still think that critics have their place. Critics generally see significantly more film than the  average moviegoer. And while I don’t think critics always determine the success of a film (the entire Jurassic franchise is evidence of that), I do think that they can be better judges of quality in a lot of instances. Critic ratings are also the make or break for some people who might do research before wanting to go and see a film (I myself have been guilty of this a number of times), so I think whenever a movie is well received, especially when it’s a franchise you like, it’s a big plus.

Which brings me back to the original question. The Jurassic Park franchise has had a hard streak of being negatively received, with the past 3 Jurassic world films now all being rated as Rotten.  And it’s not just the Jurassic franchise either, 65 was an absolute dumpsterfire, and I honestly have no high hopes for Primitive war either.

With the latest installment of Rebirth, it seems like the most common critique is that it doesn’t exactly do anything new or changes the formula of the previous films. And while I actually liked Rebirth, and thought it was a visually stunning film, I absolutely understand where they are coming from with this. Which begs the additional question, what needs to be done for a Dinosaur film to be a hit with not only fans, but movie snobs as well?

I think the first thing that comes to people’s mind might be something like a “book accurate” horror adaptation of Chrichtons Jurassic Park, and while I’d absolutely love to see that just as much as anybody, as long as Spielberg is alive, it’s pretty much a given that a reboot isn’t going to happen anytime soon, if ever.

The next thing I could think of is what I’d call a “Nosferatu” scenario, where a genuinely good dinosaur horror could be made, and be very faithful to the source material of Michael Chrichtons Jurassic Park, but under a different name to hopefully avoid copyright. The obstacle of this however, is the Chrichton estate appears to be very trigger happy for lawsuits, especially after seeing them going after HBO for “the Pitt” accusing the show of being an unapproved sequel of ER.

The last thing I could see and really hope for, is for Darren Naish to get his pitch for a big budget Dinosaur film approved. Naish is a paleontologist who has worked on tons of paleo-media, most recently Jon Favreaus Prehistoric planet, which id argue is only second to Walking with dinosaurs (1999) as the greatest Dinosaur TV-series to ever exist. If he gets something going, I’d have a lot of faith that he’d be able to pull something off that’s good.

To end my rambling I’m gonna leave off with this, what do you think needs to be done to see a praised Dino film in the future? If it’s even possible at all? And if there are any critics creeping around, what exactly do you guys want to see in a future film?? ","['Yes. They just have to stop trying to crib the JP formula.

And then I also record movies that run on tv. But almost every time I want to watch a specific movie (and that could be anything from Parasite to The Inglorious Bastards to Singing in the rain) none of these services have it. I neither wanna stream it on some skedgy website nor do I have the money to pay 4.- every time I wanna watch a movie to watch it on youtube. So, does anyone have suggestions for platforms that cover most movies? If you‘re from Switzerland, that‘s ideal because not every country has the same movies on the streaming platforms, but I take all other suggestions as well :) thank youuu

1lrpidr,movies,Saw Spirited Away on 35mm. I don't get it.,"I went to a screening of Spirited Away at an old timey theater that does 35mm film projections the other day.

In almost every way it seemed like a worse experience than a digital copy would have been. There was constant grain and white spots and white circles appearing on the screen. These never went away.

 There was very awkward skips where I imagine the reels were being switched out where the picture suddenly cuts out, like you skipped forward 10 seconds on youtube. It was very jarring and I was left wondering if I missed any dialogue because the scenes would jump so suddenly.

Do people watch movies like this just to feel cool? I'm not trying to be an ass I just don't get how this would be better than a digital copy. Did I just get a bad screening? Were these errors supposed to be there?

I could see the grain working for a live action movie but for an animated movie, whats the appeal?","[""I'm guessing it's just a bad screening.

The parts where he sees himself in the coffin or talks to people from his past were beautiful but also confusing for me.
By the end, I couldn't tell if he actually finds peace (when he's on the beach) or just accepts that he wasted parts of his life.

There is no one making full-length pictures today (as distinct from experimental shorts) who is more aware of the poetic potentialities of the film. Yet of the four Bergman pictures I have seen, one is dreadful, one pretentious, one moderately good, and the latest, Wild Strawberries, teeters on the edge of complete realization.\n\n(With foreign pictures, sequence of American release is not necessarily sequence of creation, nor do we always see all of a man’s work. We get films as and if they filter through import channels.)\n\nEven the inferior picture, Three Strange Loves, was distinguished by an investigation of emotional relationships far below the surface of most movies. His pretentious film, The Seventh Seal, was, to me, symbolically opaque and allegorically illogical; yet obviously it is the work of a man to whom the camera is a lyric instrument, who has large imagination and superb techniques.\n\nSmiles of a Summer Night was a wry, rueful sex comedy, a Victorian period piece. A friend of mine said it would have been a fine picture if a Frenchman had made it, and indeed it is worried by an un-Gallic laboring of points and an obvious load of philosophical baggage. Yet here again is a film by a man with a sympathy for arresting themes, with an eye for the possibilities of the human face, with a power to make the very form of his film serve his theme.\n\nWild Strawberries deals with a seventy-six-year-old doctor on the day he is to receive an honorary degree. He wakes from a dream of his own death, and drives from Stockholm to the university town with his daughter-in-law. She is to rejoin the doctor’s son, who teaches at the university and from whom she has been estranged by his coldness. On the way, she tells the old man that his son has inherited his coldness from him. They visit a house where his family used to summer when he was young and where he picked wild strawberries with a girl he loved and lost; he visits his mother, ninety-six, who is encased in the egotism of the ancient; he picks up several hitchhikers who represent various elements in modern life. At the end of the day, after the ceremony, he goes to bed in his son’s house, honored and sadder.\n\nThere is much in this film that is extraordinarily beautiful. The dream sequence at the beginning is a blend of Caligari and Kafka. The old man’s reminiscences of his youth at the country place are done with a warm sense of family fun that makes one yearn to have been part of it. Bergman’s touch in establishing period feeling is swift and sure—we see a young man seated in a tree reading a book, dressed in white trousers, white shirt, tie, and straw boater, and we know at once where we are. He has a gift for eccentric characterizations, like the neurotic couple to whom the doctor gives a lift and who shortly cram the interior of the car with their almost palpable unhappiness. And his basic concept—a day’s ride, a life’s journey—is a sound one.\n\nYet despite the jewels he has strung on this thread, the picture does not satisfy: precisely because they are separate jewels, not architectural blocks in a structure. The film is a series of events which do not relate or accrete strongly enough. For example, the opening dream—in itself haunting—is full of symbols which we feel are being established for later use. But only one of them—the watch without hands—is fulfilled later; the others are just vivid images that seem to have occurred to Bergman.\n\nWithout growth, the picture does not fulfill a fundamental requirement of drama: the protagonist is unchanged at the end. We are told he is different, he utters a few lines to that effect, but they seem appended, not a convincing development. At best, the immense symbolic apparatus of the picture has produced a very small result. This criticism is not academic; it is arrived at by the viewer’s solar plexus, which is knotted with impatience at the sight of all these good materials left unfused.\n\nBergman has had extensive theatrical training and experience and has recently been appointed director of the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm—at forty-one the youngest in its history. It is possible that, in contrast to the theater, he looks on the film as a free form, an opportunity for rhapsody and for that psychic exploration dear to the Scandinavian spirit and difficult on the stage. In fine imaginative surges, he tries to pry with his camera between close-knit life and death, between eternity and now. His films have an air of quest, of probing, of beating at great doors that he wants to open for himself and us.\n\nHeaven and we know that this ambition is rare and valuable in films. But if my theory is right and Bergman does view the film as a medium liberated from theatrical disciplines, he will, I think, continue to make pictures studded with beautiful episodes which an audience conditioned to form and resolution must attempt to finish for him. His scripts have a certain resemblance to the plays of the late Ugo Betti; they paddle around on great, timeless, heartaching seas. We can be grateful for the glimpses thus afforded but, although we do not expect final answers from mere fellow men, we are left dissatisfied by the errant voyagings.\n\nThis notice would be unfinished without mention of the excellent performance in the leading role by Victor Sjöström, who as Seastrom directed in Hollywood from 1923 to 1931 and has since been acting in Sweden. Some old actors’ faces have an odd childlike purity; it radiates from Sjöström. Of his many moving scenes, one moment stands out particularly. In a dream sequence, his parents, as they were when he was a child, are sitting on a rock while Father fishes. They see him, as he was then, and wave to him. We see the old man as he is now, and, with all the sadness of time past and passing, his eyes fill at the sight of them. It is lovely.\n\nPostscript. Although several subsequent viewings clarify the use of more of the symbolism, they do not alter much of the criticism above. Nevertheless, they put the picture in a higher place. With increased familiarity, its texture seems increasingly exquisite, its technique more magical, the articulation of the dream scenes more tartly imaginative.

This is the film that won all those awards? That people have as the number one movie of the decade? The decade??

The kid had the admiration of the family, and she trusted his recommendation. Why did they even need to lie about being family. Wouldn't it be even better if he just said hey my sister happens to be an amazing art student.

They had 8 minutes to clean the house. There were smashed bottles of booze everywhere, food mess, the girl was in the bath a few minutes ago, they laid in the beds. It goes on and on. Not to mention they were all smashed drunk, which they all immediately became sober, a horrendous writing trope.

So they push all that mess under the tables and in the drawers in 8 min? Are we joking here? The smells alone, I mean, come on.

Then they hide under the table? Is this an episode of Full House? Three grown people hide under a coffee table for hours with the owners 2 feet away and go unnoticed. There wasn't even a tv or radio on. It's literally impossible for a person to remain that quiet, that close for that long.

Anyway, like I said overall I did enjoy it, but all those terrible tropes and its film of the decade? Im baffled.

1lrlcyy,movies,School of Rock - Most Iconic Quotes?,"For a while I've been interested in why/how movie lines can stick in peoples' heads to the point that they become quoted in everyday conversations. While some films are ""quotation-dense"" like The Princess Bride (1987), Forrest Gump (1994), and The Terminator (1984), there are others which only have one or two lines which make it into the public consciousness.

I re-watched Richard Linklater's 2003 film ""School of Rock"" recently and feel like it falls into the latter category.  While I've heard people say lines like ""You're not hardcore...unless you live hardcore!"" and ""Now raise your goblet of rock"" before, it's certainly not the most quoted film of all time (this might be because it was a cult classic and not a smash hit, but maybe you attribute this lack of blockbuster success to its low-quotability?).

1lrl2u0,movies,How many of you have watched Nepali films?,"I'm curious to get a sense of how many Redditors here have actually watched Nepali films. Whether it was a recent release, a classic like Basudev or Jhola, or something you just stumbled upon on YouTube or a streaming platform, what was your overall experience? Did you enjoy it, find it interesting, or perhaps a bit challenging to watch? Share your thoughts!
Nepali cinema, often affectionately called 'Kollywood' by some, has a unique charm and its own set of strengths and challenges. While it might not have the global reach of Bollywood or Hollywood, many Nepali films offer a truly authentic glimpse into Nepali culture, society, and diverse landscapes, from the bustling streets of Kathmandu to the serene villages in the Himalayas.
I'm particularly interested in hearing about your first impressions. Did anything about the storytelling, acting, music, or even the technical aspects surprise you? Were there any specific themes that resonated with you, perhaps related to family values, social issues, or historical events? Given that we're here in Kathmandu, it's a topic that feels very relevant to local conversations about media and identity.
I know some recent films like Jaaari, Pashupati Prasad, Kalo Pothi, and the Kabaddi series have garnered significant attention both within Nepal and among the Nepali diaspora. If you've seen any of these, or perhaps older gems like Kagbeni or Loot, I'd love to hear your specific reviews. What worked for you, and what didn't?
On the other hand, if you haven't watched any Nepali films, what has deterred you? Is it accessibility, lack of awareness, or perhaps past experiences that haven't piqued your interest? Nepali cinema is constantly evolving, with new independent filmmakers pushing boundaries and exploring diverse narratives, so it's always interesting to see how perceptions are changing. Let's share your thoughts!","['I have only seen one, Loot, but I liked how it showed everyday life and had a fresh vibe.', 'Are those available in other languages or where to watch', ""Last year I got a chance to see a Nepali film called Kusma at a screening in Hong Kong.

1lrjrzn,movies,Hear me out: Death Becomes Her is basically a dark comedy version of Sunset Boulevard,"
Both films centre around aging actresses who refuse to accept that their youth and fame are long gone. Norma Desmond and Madeline Ashton are basically cut from the same cloth. They’re both living in fantasy worlds, surrounded by reminders of their past glory, doing everything they can to pretend time hasn’t touched them. Norma clings to old film reels and delusions of a comeback. Madeline drinks a potion and literally becomes immortal. Different tone, same fear, irrelevance.

They also share this intense jealousy when “their” man starts loving someone else. In Sunset Boulevard, it’s Joe Gillis. In Death Becomes Her, it’s Ernest. That jealousy builds until it tips over into madness and, eventually, murder. Both women go down with the ship, clutching their illusions of beauty and control.

And here’s a detail I’ve always found weirdly perfect. When Norma first meets Joe, she mistakes him for a mortician. But in Death Becomes Her, Ernest actually is a mortician. He literally specializes in making the dead look alive. The symbolism is so on the nose it almost loops back around to genius.

Of course, the tones are completely different. Sunset Boulevard is noir tragedy, Death Becomes Her is full-blown camp. But they’re both sharp critiques of Hollywood’s obsession with youth, beauty, and fame. One just plays it straight, the other goes off the rails in the best way possible.

So yeah. Sunset Boulevard walked so Death Becomes Her could teeter in wearing heels, half a spine, and a wildly inappropriate hat.

1lrif3z,movies,Why is it that movie antiheroes are seen as such by audiences but tv antiheroes are often seen as heroes by audiences?,"I have noticed that quite often, when a movie character is supposed to be the antiheroes, audiences are generally quick to recognize him or her as that, even if they root for said character, they still see this character as not really a typical hero. Patrick Bateman, Alex DeLarge, Dirty Harry Callahan, Barry Lyndon, The Man With No Name, Tyler Durden, Tom Ripley, etc. There are exceptions, but for the most part audiences seem to be in on the fact that the protagonist is not an ideal hero one should root for otherwise.

By contrast, when a tv character is supposed to be an antihero, audiences generally assumed him or her to be the hero and actively root for him or her. This generally happens with Tony Soprano or Walter White. Legions of fans love these guys and hate their antagonists like their wives, especially Skylar.

Why is this the case? Why are movie antiheroes seen as such and appreciated for that while tv antiheroes are generally mistaken for heroes by the audience? Is it because movies are better at portraying antiheroes than tv is? Is it because movie audiences understand and recognize them better than tv audiences do?

I think that one explanation could be found in the history of both media. Before the Hays Code, there were several 1930s gangster movies like Scarface or Little Caesar that had anti heroic protagonists. James Cagney became the face of the antihero gangster. As late as 1939, Gone With the Wind had perhaps cinema’s first female antihero, Scarlet O’Hara, an icon ever since. When the code was lifted in the 60s, there was an explosion of anti hero films, such as Bonnie and Clyde, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Dirty Harry, The Dollars Trilogy, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Pulp Fiction, Easy Rider, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, Psycho, etc. Movie antiheroes are not slowing down.

By contrast tv only recently started having antiheroes, with shows like Breaking Bad and The Sopranos coming out in the late 90s and early aughts. Perhaps tv has not had enough time to deal with antiheroes the way that cinema has. Perhaps tv audiences are not used to having antihero protagonists the way that movie fans have been able to since the early days of cinema.

Anyone have any other explanations?","['TV shows give audiences more time to bond and become attached to anti-hero characters.', 'Potentially because TV gives the writers time to flesh out the characters more and thus provide more motivation and justification for the acts of the character.

I sincerely do find Don more scary than Anton because Don Logan is the sort of psychotic you might have even experienced in life - he wears violence on his sleeve, he is unhinged, and needs to be in absolute control, but under the surface, you have this tormented soul who is anything but in control. When Gal tries to leave his life of crime behind him and just relax in Spain, Don is tasked with offering him a job to do, when Gal refuses, things get tense.

This film does not have masses of physical violence.. the violence is psychological, and it comes in spades in this film. I promise you that you will love this film - you might want sub titles because the cockney accents are strong with this one. Please watch it, and please enjoy.","[""Preparation, preparation, preparation.\n\n\nI would say Iain McShane is far more menacing, that look he gives Ray Winstone when he asks him where Donny is and he immediately knows Ray's dispatched him.

""Hey Verne!""

It's clear these two franchises share the same universe. But let's discuss it. First, who is Verne?

Verne Brown of course creates the Biff character through temporal resonance.

Earnest on the other hand:

Met Santa
Avoided the law
Summoned troll demons
Gained superpowers to join the NBA
Survived African warlords

Basically he's a Leprechaun, and his purpose is to tie up knots in history. He is attracted to Verne, who, in later life is attempting to avoid Langolier like demons that hunt time travelers. While Verne has the tech to stave off the Langoliers, Earnest is like a moth to flame, always interfering in Verne's life and and causing chaos.

Verne accepts this knowing that what Earnest is is a thing that wouldn't destroy him, only bring chaos and annoyance. So he tolerates Earnest. In some ways, Earnest wards off, through metaphysical stink, Langolier type entities.

1lr8bp3,movies,A Movie I Would Love To Watch,"It's been bothering me like crazy so I thought of dumping this somewhere. ANYWHERE.

Basically, the movie is like those detective/noir style kinda movie. But instead of the camera shots being like you see normally, it's by room on one perspective. Like you're watching a theatre play being done on stage but on you're screen.

Movie starts with a grieving widow who had lost her husband. Her husband had been murdered in his bed. The detective works on the case and comforts the widow. Soon, stuff unfolds and it's been found out that the deceased husband had been cheating on the wife. She was suspected but in the end, the mistress was convicted for murder.

Here's the twist.

Right at the end, the mistress and her partner gets arrested and it was chaos. And THEN, the screen just ZOOMS in. For the first time, the scene changes. It zooms in to the widow in the middle of the room as she grieves. It zooms into her face in which she covers with her well manicured hands. Red nail polish. It also shows a mark on her finger where her wedding band used to sit on. And then, she drops her hands, and she shows a cold face. Lighting changes to red. A song like I SEE RED by Everybody Loves An Outlaw starts playing.

Then it zooms out to her already knowing that her husband had been cheating on her long before. Then her systematically planning her own husband's murder and framing it on the mistress.

AHHHHHHHH. I feel much better now that I dumped it all here.

This story isn't exactly new or one of a kind. But, what drives me insane is if the movie could be made in the perspective that I mentioned earlier. Like a play on a stage. Camera is unmoving, only the characters move about. As for the reveal of the widow, it'd be crazy if the perspective changes. It's not the play anymore. The camera follows her along, basically showing that the entire movie was a play she had orchestrated for her revenge.

I would absolutely love to watch this.

There were 2 songs that inspired me.

1lr4nsi,movies,What movie has the best platonic relationship between a guy and a girl?,"There are many people that argue that a guy and a girl can’t JUST be friends, especially if both parties are heterosexual. Because depending on how close they become, it is usually inevitable that they will become sexually and emotionally attracted to the other.

However, I personally believe the opposite and that it is possible for a guy and a girl to be very close without there being any hints of romance.

One good example that I can think of is the friendship between Jess and Leslie from the Disney film; Bridge to Terabithia (2007)! Their friendship was the heart and overall story of the movie, and it was so heartwarming to watch that friendship develop before it took a devastating turn with Leslie’s death.

Sure it could be argued that Jess was realizing that he was romantically falling in love with Leslie, and there were some hints of a romance sparking between them before she died. But it was still a great friendship, where there was a great deal of love between them without needing to become a couple. ","['Dungeons & Dragons Honour Among Thieves (the recent one).

1lr4exe,movies,How would you write a movie script about a protagonist trying to kill a time traveler who resets the world on their death?,"The title basically. I've stumbled upon a very well made video by the title ""How do you kill a time traveller"". It's pretty good and obviously draws from the story of Undertale, but still stands on its own as a very detailed breakdown of how someone would approach dealing with a temporal anomaly. A movie based on this idea would just be insanely engaging to me, but even trying to think of how to make one breaks my brain. Temporal movies are already hard to conceptualize if you control the power, but what if you don't?

EDIT: Don't bring up Edge of Tomorrow, it's the complete opposite of the POV I'm talking about. Imagine the POV of the aliens trying to kill the protagonist in Edge of Tomorrow.","['Edge of Tomorrow.', ""Does the protagonist know they do this?

So in said universe, the assassin successfully kills the traveller and their life goes on and the traveller is simply now dead.
