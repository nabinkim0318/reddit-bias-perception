The few people who appeared during the movie had strange ""masks"" and were trying to hunt our character for this apparent ""crime.""

1lso72l,movies,Recommendations for Robot Movies?,"I've been doing a self-imposed challenge this year. Every Monday, I watch a different Nicolas Cage film. I'm halfway through the year now, and I'm loving it! Forcing myself to watch a thing I otherwise might not ever touch has forced me out of my normal film taste, and having such a defined structure has been a way to keep myself going through it.

With that said, I want to do it again in 2026 with a new theme. Nicolas Cage has been a great subject, but has some limitations. A lot of his work can be pretty samey, and basically everything is feature-length. Sometimes finding an entire 90 minutes on a Monday is super difficult, and I want to give myself some leeway.

So I'm trying to do robots next year. Anything robots. I thought asking people here would be better than just googling and making a list on my own. All recommendations will go into a list on Letterboxd for myself so I can pick through it through the year.

Requirements:

‚ö™ The movie has to have a robot in it. It doesn't have to be a starring role. It can even just be one scene. But preferably, the robot would have some significance to the themes of the film.

‚ö™ A robot can be a lot of different things, but it needs to have some sense of humanity. Blade Runner counts. Transformers counts. Even Interstellar counts. Sonic the Hedgehog (with the little drone robots) doesn't count.

‚ö™ Short films and documentaries are a plus, to space out normal feature films.

‚ö™ Bad movies are awesome! Like I said, I'm watching Nic Cage movies this year. My tolerance for bad movies is pretty high.

‚ö™ It needs to have a Letterboxd entry. Sorry, that's just how I track my movie habits. If it's not on Letterboxd, I may still watch it, but it won't be part of this.

So, what do you recommend?","['Ex Machina', '# Short Circuit\n\n# Short Circuit 2', 'Batteries not included', 'Bicentennial Man', ""The Wild Robot.

1lso00g,movies,In defense of Rotten Tomatoes,"Rotten Tomatoes gets clowned on a lot. And I somewhat get it. Because a 90% doesn‚Äôt mean critics on average give it a 9/10, just that 90% of critics liked it well enough to give it a positive recommendation.

Now there are exceptions, but for me that binary system actually works really well for me determining if I‚Äôm going to enjoy a film or not. It‚Äôs not a predictor of the degree to which I‚Äôll enjoy a film, but it‚Äôs a powerful predictor as to the likelihood I‚Äôll enjoy a movie.

Like I‚Äôll see basically anything with 90+% score and be guaranteed I‚Äôll basically like it, even if the film wasn‚Äôt on my radar. It‚Äôs also a good guarantee that my friends and/or dates will like it, because ultimately the tomato score is an arbiter of broad appeal.

Ironically my favorite films tend to have a slightly lower RT film, just because usually to become a favorite, it has to do something really distinctive and have a strong POV from the film maker, which usually means it‚Äôs a bit more divisive. But those usually end up at arthouse theaters and I let those theaters generally curate for me.

So basically when it comes to broad appeal movies in non arthouse theaters, RT is pretty powerful predictor IMO in a way that a simply aggregated score isn‚Äôt ","[""If you're able to watch a lot of movies and are trying to decide whether a movie is worth watching, it can be very useful.\n\nIf you're not able to see every movie you want to see and you're trying to decide *which* movie to watch out of several possibilities, it's not the right tool for that job"", ""They don't have any reviews from the illustrious David Manning of The Ridgefield Press, so I don't know what the point even is."", '80 critics review a movie\n58 critics rate fresh\n22 critics rate rotten\n\n58/80=0.725 which puts the movie at 72% rated fresh but for some reason RT puts the movie at 86% and says certified fresh.\n\nRT is rotten.', 'Because they\'ve reduced actual movie criticism to a number.

Then a few months after, things start to settle down and get more accurate.', 'Don‚Äôt downvote to disagree, upvote to raise up the discussion and state your disagreement\xa0\n\nI can agree OP there‚Äôs value to RT if you understand the implication/meaning behind their score\xa0', 'It‚Äôs good for older movies not new ones', ""It's a system designed for creating confusion (and for studios to take advantage of that confusion since they know most people won't realize what a 90% fresh rating actually means)."", 'I view Rotten Tomatoes to be a service, not a statement..\n\n\nSure there\'s a generic summary that attempts to focus on the highlights of reviews-\n\n"" This film is exciting, but stumbles against the weight of its own grandeur"" but it in theory lets the reviewers put their own fresh or rotten rating, and collects a lot of reviews like Metacritic. \n\nHowever I do think  a lot of the tension between high art and entertainment  ( that\'s been around for quite some time but this is another lecture)  is that something artistically ambitious but controversial will generally get a lower score then something that\'s designed to be entertaining, but has micromanaged the storytelling around formulas that work. \n\n\nSo it\'s kind of like the 88% fresh superhero movie versus the subversive psychological thriller at like 45%..\n\nNow I\'ll inevitably say that you could have people who dislike the art  film at 5 and people who like the film giving things 8 or 9.-  the superhero movie that eight out of 10 reviewers give a six. \n\nI think on one hand, I believe that a lot of stydios create hype by giving people advance screenings which tends to tilt things in the positive direction, on another thing there\'s the awkward element of paid reviewers usually for below the radar lower budget screenings. \n\nI\'m not saying major studios don\'t straight-up pay people to give positive reviews, but from  the articles I\'ve read is that it\'s more films that might not get critics if they didn\'t pay the screen.\n\nSo maybe that is where it all kind of goes is that readers of Rotten Tomatoes are giving information too quickly for them to summarize on their own.\n\nA good example is rotten tomatoes and TV - a lot of critics are quick to say a TV show is good or bad with an amount of five or so episodes reviewed.\n\nBut if TV series are very extensive, with over 20 episodes it really isn\'t the best sampling size to make binary judgment. \n\nSo maybe going back to film - I think it\'s easier for companies to make movies that everybody likes and nobody loves, than the opposite.\n\nI also find that Metacritic\'s thorough indexting on film critics tends to pull the positive scores down.\n\nSo maybe something like rotten tomatoes 95 would be Metacritic\'s 81.\n\nAlso a bad premiere can skew down critic scores - initially Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny got negative reviews at Cannes, which did give it negative response on the Tomato Meter for quite some time.\n\nAlso it seems like an approach that movie studios tend to do is when the early reviews hit and if they\'re positive, promotional materials say ""certified fresh""  at this time before more critics watch it.\n\nReally I think the better evaluation is something like Letterboxd\nor Criricker ( I like this website!)  though the long established Rotten Tomatoes is something that is a bit of a cultural touchstone. \n\nIn many ways it\'s kind of what you make of it.']","[""If you're able to watch a lot of movies and are trying to decide whether a movie is worth watching, it can be very useful.\n\nIf you're not able to see every movie you want to see and you're trying to decide *which* movie to watch out of several possibilities, it's not the right tool for that job"", 'Because they\'ve reduced actual movie criticism to a number.

1lskla4,movies,What are some other big budget but experimental films?,"TL;Dr - what major releases or big-budget films essentially are experimental films in disguise?

----

I went to school in Boulder, and I was lucky enough to do a little film School under Bruce Kawin, but the real point is that I sold Stan Brakhage cigarettes at Jones drug on the hill and I got to talk to him a lot. It was really rewarding, and it gave me a fascinating insight to experimental filmmaking that I hadn't considered prior to meeting him or having a little film theory injected into my brain.

So I'm obviously not talking about moth light or really niche experimental filmmaking. But rather, what are some big budget films that essentially act like Blockbusters or big releases that are truly doing something experimental?

Namely, Interstellar with the sound design, or Warfare by Alex Garland as an experiment in memory versus objective reality. I am endlessly fascinated by the latter film.

Alex Garland worked with a Marine to present what essentially is a nonfiction autobiographical retelling of a short battle in Iraq. So Warfare is a study in the malleability of memory in context of talking to all the Marines and trying to piece together the literal nonfiction objective reality account, and they still ran into impossibly complex contradictions where you could objectively know they misremembered things. It's a fascinating experiment in filmmaking. It is neither a rah rah pro-America pro-War film nor is it a anti War film. It's almost like Michael Heneke, forcing the audience to do the work themselves. Any objective observer would easily review the nonfiction account and arrive at their own conclusion.

So what are other major or large or big budget releases that were essentially experimental in nature in some manner or regard?","['Charlie Kaufman movies are usually well funded and pretty out there conceptually. \n\nBeing John Malkovich is a prime example.', 'Megalopolis, lol.', '**2001: A Space Odyssey** is an epic Hollywood Art Film.', 'Does Cats 2019 count ?', 'Barbie', 'Monkeybone.\n\nLive action/Stop motion Movie with Brendan Fraser.

Has hit movies across genres: action, (The Nice Guys), comedy (The Big Short-a comedic role at least), romcom (Crazy, Stupid, Love), blockbuster, (Barbie), scifi (Blade Runner), thriller (Drive), romance (The Notebook), quirky (Lars and The Real Girl), artsy (Blue Valentine, The Place Beyond the Pines), musical (La La Land)

\- Little to no controversy surrounding him.

\- Popular with both men and women.

\- Not oversaturated by being in a shit load of ads or podcasts or media stunts.

\- Respected in pop culture: memes, things like SNL appearances, interviews.

\- Was sometimes mocked for understated performances like Drive early in his career but that seems to have faded with a wide range of performances.

Leo - Wins on resume and range but not popular with women who can't stand his dating preferences.

Pitt - Also wins on resume, has similar range, more controversial reputation.

Cruise - Biggest movie star for a long time, has the most hits but a long list of controversial lifestyle choices.

1lsfvgt,movies,Why I think Brad Pitt is a cooler / better star than Tom Cruise?,"Below views are my opinion, no offense to anyone.

I'm not saying this just after watching F1 - it's something I've always felt and F1 just reinforced that idea.


**Tom Cruise** \- Always has this 'I know I am amazing' kind of egoistic-proud look on his face at all times - I mean even on-screen over the past few (7-8) years including recent MI movies.

Sure, he may have had that 'innocence' in his younger days in films like Vanilla Sky, Minority Report etc.But not these days. The ego, the fame has gotten to his head but more importantly it SHOWS on his face and persona. Same thing with DiCaprio.


But here's where our man is different:

**Brad Pitt** \- From a film back in the day like 7 years in Tibet - till today in OUATIH or F1, Pitt's face still has a certain 'vulnerability' - it doesn't scream 'yo I'm a rich superstar and know everything' , there's a certain 'I've gone through a lot of struggle to get here and there's a lot  beneath this cool exterior and swag' kinda thing about him.

That's why when he plays roles like F1 where 'he was once a successful dude who lost everything and is now having a second chance to prove himself' - we feel that emotion and root for him as his eyes, his wrinkles convey a certain level of that 'pain'.

And most of the world isn't rich - most of the world are people 'trying' to succeeed and get better and have many struggles to deal with. So a story + actor/role that embodies that feeling is always likely to hit home!

Let me know what you feel about this thought of mine :)","['I like his acting, but im not gonna make a huge ass post glazing a wife beater.', 'I‚Äôve never understood ‚Äúnormies‚Äù who create entire lore, opinions, and dissertations on celebrities based just on their ‚Äúvibe‚Äù. \n\n‚ÄúWell, they just come off like‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nNo, that‚Äôs you, 100%.

1lseqga,movies,Something surreal happened to me today ‚Äî watched Oldboy on July 5th,"
So today (July 5th), I randomly decided to watch *Oldboy* (the original 2003 Korean film). I‚Äôve been putting it off forever, always telling myself I‚Äôd watch it *some day*.

No particular reason why today ‚Äî just felt like finally seeing what the hype was about.

Turns out (major spoiler if you haven‚Äôt seen it) **the entire climax of the movie revolves around July 5th.** It‚Äôs literally the date on the calendar that triggers the big reveal.

I had absolutely no idea about this going in. It was just a total coincidence. Watching that scene *today* gave me actual chills.

What‚Äôs even weirder is this isn‚Äôt the first time something like this has happened to me. I‚Äôve had a few strangely timed experiences where I watched or read something at the exact date it references, or learned something that suddenly became hyper-relevant.

Not sure why, but little moments like this feel almost supernatural. Like life has weird glitches or winks that line up just right.

Anyone else ever experience oddly timed coincidences like this? Would love to hear your stories.

They also contain themes of masculinity. Focusing on relationships between men. Warrior about the bonds of brotherhood and The Place Beyond The Pines being the legacy of fathers to thier sons. All while trying to provide for thier loved ones the best way they know how.

1lse8uf,movies,"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) is one those films that while influential, bears little resemblance to the movies it inspired.","The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (sic) was shot in a month during a heat-wave on a budget of nothing. For a grindhouse horror film there isn't that much visible blood, nor is there any nudity. The director Tobe Hooper was honestly banking on the film earning a PG rating at the time. It got an R, but also made turned a profit thirty times over. The cast was made up of locals, and it was filmed around three buildings, a graveyard, and inside a van.

Massacre is one of those interesting films because, while it inspired later slasher films, the movie itself had no rulebook to follow. The plot and script is thin, more a disturbing trip than anything. There are five main characters and I couldn't tell you their names except for the annoying guy in a wheelchair, Franklin. Apparently his actor stayed in character between filming, which pissed off the rest of the cast and crew. It may reflect badly on me finding it a relief when Leatherface carves a defenceless man in wheelchair like a Christmas turkey, but I'll take what I'm given.

Four of the five leads are killed in quick succession in the middle act, having no idea they're in a horror-movie until it's too late. We don't know them too well, and they don't fit any archetypes. They're not characters, more just random people. Aside from an encounter with a creepy hitchhiker and a spot of grave-robbing I was surprised at how normal the first act of the movie is compared the depravity of the last.

When I saw the excellent **Sinners** there was only scene I thought was superfluous and that's the first one. It's a flash-forward depicting one of the survivors after the main event and we briefly get a glimpse of the vampires. This felt like a pointless concession as the actual first scene properly establishes the same character, while the vampires don't appear until the first act is over, a la **From Dusk til Dawn**.

Here, Leatherface is interesting as a villain because he comes absolutely out of nowhere. There's no scare chord, no POV shot of him at his work, no prior hint to his existence. Thirty-five minutes into the movie a guy walks into a country house in the afternoon, and then he's bludgeoned to death by a giant butcher wearing a flayed face as a mask.

Leatherface isn't the sole villain either. Instead he's just the pitiable son or brother in a family of cannibals, incapable of communicating normally. None of the villains are named, nor are they invincible. One of them gets run over in the street, and Leatherface gets belted in the face with a wrench. I find it  interesting when antagonists in horror movies experience their own setbacks. Unless they're a zombie or explicitly supernatural, they should suffer the occasional pratfall. While the family may bicker and act camp, the film itself never wavers from its gritty and bleak tone.

There's a lot of aspects to the film's production that obviously shouldn't be replicated. They used a live chainsaw which almost killed Leatherface's actor on more than one occasion. The leading lady was thrown out a window and had her finger cut and sucked by another actor. The crew also spent entire days filming the dining-room scene, having to contend with the heatwave and long-spoiled food. Pretty much nobody had to act in the deranged climax

Massacre is an 80 minute-film about a gang of hapless young adults getting carved up by cannibals. Where it a better movie it'd be considerably worse. Had the camerawork been more elaborate, the acting more professional, and the special-effects like the old-man mask been of higher quality, the results would have been less interesting. You need a considerable budget if you're depicting a shapeshifting alien in the Antarctic, or having a housefly transform into Jeff Goldblum. But for a minor bloodbath in Texas the raw and unpolished feel is the film's best aspect. The director's own sequel was a black comedy, while every other follow-up just kind of existed. The last one made jabs at millennials for some reason.

While it may not be worth trying to recapture the lightning in a bottle, given how many of the sequels flopped, I think the method of Massacre is still fertile for horror. By shooting the horror like a straight documentary instead of a lavish Hollywood film, you make the viewer feel like an uncomfortable witness instead of a safe audience. The horror can happen in the middle of the day with zero warning in a local neighbourhood. The soundtrack can be either absent or come across as utterly maumed, and maybe pay John Larroquette in weed to do the opening narration again.","['Black Christmas really started the slasher genre imo. \n\nTexas chainsaw helped but it was much different. \n\nThe films I think resemble Texas chainsaw more are going to be the grainy horrors like \n\n-the devils rejects / 1000 corpses \n\n- hills have eyes\n\n- X\n\nAnd like you said the budget and disgust of filming in that Texas heatwave will never be replicated so it is hard to see that on screen.', ""Great read and completely agree, it has been said by many before including myself but it really captured this feeling of watching something that you're not meant to be watching and still holds up."", 'As muddled as it is, I legit think Texas Chainsaw 4, with McConaughey, has merit.\n\nIt isn\'t nowhere near the masterpiece of insanity as the original, but as a send-up and fuck you to 90s horror, it\'s interesting.\n\nThe family has been neutered...no longer cannibals and instead are pizza loving goofs who fall into cult/conspiracy theory groups.

1lsdoni,movies,In defense of Rebel Moon,"I've just finished the two directors' cut versions of the rebel moon movies and, with a few exceptions, really loved them. I haven't seen the previous versions. For the record I don't give a shit about Zack Snyder, I never really liked any of these movies, even his first ones.



I'll take a scene at the beginning of the second film to explain why I really liked them, I'll keep it vague so as not to spoil it. In the first third of Rebel Moon part 2, there's a surprise assassination scene on a ship. Some people arrive, thinking they're inaugurating the ship, and everyone gets killed. A string quartet in the corner accompanies the scene, surprisingly adapting what they're playing to what's happening in front of them. The whole thing is, of course, full of slow motion and superfluous effect. And I loved this scene as much as I loved the film, because Snyder and the people around him weren't afraid to be absolutely grandiloquent and ridiculous, taking themselves very seriously to make something epic, in the literal sense of the word, something with big feelings, melodrama, very nasty villains and ultra-heroic heroes. And with the prevalence of Marvelization of films (compare Old Guard to its sequel, for example) where everything is a joke and nothing is to be taken seriously, well, it's good to see something where they‚Äôre not afraid of being ridiculous. It's absolutely dramatic in the best sense of the word, and it's good to see that kind of thing.¬†



I even liked the harvest scene, it was beautiful.



So yes, I know symbolism is the most in-your-face symbolism in the world, the action scenes are based on the rule of cool rather than common sense (thank you General Titus for your strategy of making a bunch of peasants run screaming rather than hiding in buildings to snipe at the bad guys), and the visual effects are so present that some scenes are 50% random fireflies, but that's it, it's a pleasure to see, the actors are all beautiful, the robot Jimmy has an incredible design and it's Anthony Hopkins who tells poetry, it's the kind of work that also makes me have big emotions.



Yes, it's very cheesy and grandiloquent, yes there's a lot of slow motion and everything is enormously produced, but we're entitled to say that it's cool and that sometimes it's good when things are cool. Slow motion isn't bad in itself, and here it's used to create tableaux, to say ‚Äúlook how classy this thing is‚Äù, and while I understand that some may find it tiresome, I got a real kick out of it. Yes, it's not Macbeth, but it's grandiose and I found that enjoyable. Rebel Moon is the 7 Samurai in the Warhammer 40k universe, with fireflies everywhere.¬†



I really hope to have more of it, I want to keep experiencing this universe.



I've written all this not to defend my opinion, and not even really to defend the film (yeah the title is misleading), just to ask you not to put them aside just because of what you've read about them.","['I kind of liked them, I definitely want to know how the story continues.', 'I liked it.

1lsbebx,movies,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly; why was Clint Eastwood's character ""The Good""?","I'd argue his character was worse than Tuco, as he is the one who started the cycle of backstabbing. He intentionally sabotaged their scam, was the first to leave him dehydrated in the desert, then lies about the name (Tuco would've backstabbed him here regardless as he wasn't aware he lied, but he was still honest about the cemetery name).

Most of Tuco's backstabbing's were in response to something Blondie did first, or after the cycle of trust had been broken. Is it because Clint Eastwood is cool?

I actually found myself rooting for The Bad because he was an outside force.

The only good thing that Blondie did was show humanity to the dying soldier, The Bad similarly showed humanity to the guy he gave the alcohol to. I'd say none of them were better than the other.","[""Because calling it The Bad, the Appaling and the Worse wouldn't have the same ring"", ""I mean, I think it's pretty clear that they're grading on a curve lol"", 'Tuco all but threatened to kill Blondie in their first scene together after Blondie helped him escape. He basically says that if Blondie ever even considers betraying him, he\'ll kill him. \n\nIn response, Blondie does indeed stab him in the back. I\'ve always assumed that his betrayal wasn\'t out of greed, after all he does let Tuco keep his money. It was mainly because ""professionals have standards"" and Blondie was the one with the gun and Tuco was the one in the rope. You don\'t *threaten* the one with the gun if you\'re the one in the rope.

Also, miscegenation which is less important but it was a big deal back then lol\n\nBlondie was **the Good** out of the three. He was the one comforting soldiers who knew they were dying.

You already mentioned the dying soldier, but there\'s more.\n\nAt the bridge, Blondie chooses to tell the dying commander to listen, as good news is coming. He didn\'t have to do that and didn\'t get anything out of it, but in doing so he was being kind to worn out man who gets to die happier, knowing that the hated bridge would be destroyed and no more men would die for it.\n\nFinally, while he does it in a very dick way, Blondie spares Tuco and leaves him his share of the money. There was no particular motivation for him to do either other than goodness as we see very clearly that Tuco and Blondie are not friends and have no loyalty to each other, but keeping your word when you not only have nothing to gain, but things to lose, is a sign of goodness. Blondie could have just blown Tuco away, taken all the money, and nobody would have ever known, but he doesn\'t. \n\nIn closing, Blondie might be a dick, but he\'s not a complete a-hole.', ""So I mean it's all relative. Tuco is a rapist, a murderer, a gang member. Angel Eyes is an assassin who will kill anyone unquestionably for money. The nameless gunman is just an opportunist and a conman. He does questionable things sure. But as a rule he's pretty honest with people. He might leave them in situations that aren't ideal but he normally leaves them with a chance. Which is often more than the other two would."", 'Remember, they‚Äôre all outlaws. When you‚Äôre an outlaw, Blondie is as good as they get. It‚Äôs Leone‚Äôs way of showing how wild his Wild West is. It‚Äôs a very dark, cynical joke, as are all of Leone‚Äôs westerns.\n\nBut if you want more than that, look at how they kill.\n\nBlondie kills out of self defense. Even at the beginning when Tuco becomes a liability, Blondie gives him a slight chance at survival.\n\nTuco also only kills out of defense with the exception of his revenge on Blondie, and likewise, Blondie survives.\n\nAngel Eyes is bad because of his sadism. He kills because he enjoys it. Blondie would have never killed the farmer at the beginning. Tuco probably would have, and it might have nagged at him, but money‚Äôs money.

Some reasonable restrictions include not letting kids watch R-Rated movies with lots of swearing and/or violence.

Very religious parents might refuse to let their kids watch things they consider Satanic or pagan. They might think a movie is too violent even if it's just unserious cartoon violence. They might dislike that the child characters in the movie ""disrespect authority"" and thus might be a bad influence. They might just hate foreign media and thus don't want their kids to watch those ugly Japanimations. They might buy into culture war nonsense and not want their kids to watch any movie in which gay people exist.

1ls8c50,movies,The StormPAR Subplot in Twisters (2024) Makes Absolutely No Sense,"So it's revealed that StormPAR is tracking these tornados at the behest of a nefarious profiteer, Marshall Riggs, who is otherwise funding their science. He's using their knowledge of where a tornado has recently hit to go and buy up the survivor's land for cheap.

**Except that information is useless,** because everyone already knows if a town has been wiped out by a tornado, because it's immediately in the news. Shared on social media. Just _freely_ published in weather reporting data online.

Spending (presumably) tens of millions to know potentially minutes quicker is of absolutely no benefit. It's like hiring someone to let you know if your house has burned down, you'll already fucking know!

---

**Easy-fix**; change it so Marshall is funding StormPAR to predict where _future_ tornados are going to happen, allowing him to short companies with resources in the area (e.g. that oil refinery), or to buy up businesses _ahead_ of time, and slapping massive insurance policies on inflated associated assets.

If they die, or come back without death, he will open the gates of hell, and start biblical event, called The Judgement Day. But there will be no god to stop him, only The end itself.

I SENT LINK TO THIS FILM, SO IF SOMEONE IS INTERESTED THEY CAN WATCH.

So, the movie is made by 3 15-yo people. YES. not only this, but at some moment it gets so fucking intense just from the soundtrack. It's not a normal horror movie, since it's telling a story that is not being filmed by cameras or whatever, but has animations, and clips, showing The Devil, Death, (SPOILER - The Angel of Truth  ) and fallen angels. Sadly, it has no English subtitles, so if you don't understand polish language, you will not understand what is going on.
For me, very underrated horror film that has elements I don't think a lot of people ever saw in a horror movie.

1ls2dvf,movies,What's a Movie you Love that isn't widely popular?,"As the question asks, I wanted to know if anyone else has a story like mine. For me, the choice was a toss-up between Daredevil starring Ben Affleck and Atlantis: The Lost Empire. After thinking it over, I have to give it to Atlantis. I loved that film for everything it was and what it represented to me.

I saw it in theaters with someone very important to me, someone who has since passed away. To this day, I can't watch it without tearing up a little. I remember that person, of course, but I also find myself marveling at how much I still love the characters, the world, and the experience. I often wonder when the last time was that I felt so deeply immersed in a Disney animated film.

I can‚Äôt speak for anyone else, but that theater experience was unforgettable. As a kid, I couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around how they pulled off the animation, the angles, the sense of movement, the way it felt like we were surfacing through water. It was stunning.

And to add another layer, the person I saw it with was a big fan of Jim Varney, who voiced a character in the film. Atlantis was his final role, which made it all the more meaningful.

So, what about you? What film holds a special place in your heart, and why? I‚Äôd love to hear your stories.

1ls25c8,movies,I'm very confused about the plot of the Usual Suspects.,"Please don't read further if you don't want spoilers.

So. The entire goal is getting rid of some person who knows who Kyser Soze is and has been ratting on him.

Why insert yourself into a position to be caught? Just have someone else do it? And now the polixe know it's you? No more hiding. And if you were fine hiding before, then just keep doing it?

Love the movie, but ultimately he killed a bunch of people to keep from being identified then identified himself to multiple cops...

Isn't that kinda nonsensical?","[""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\n\nThere *is* no Keyser Soze.  :)"", 'My takeaway after years of rewatching it is that he is Soze, but it doesn\'t matter if Kujan can take a sketch dictated by a dying man and say ""Keyser Soze is one Roger \'Verbal\' Kint!"" because Verbal doesn\'t exist.

1ls23ox,movies,ID4,"Mandatory rewatching, my (half baked, moronic, and otherwise) observations

- Russell Case is a god damn American Icon in this household. There was a post the other day about movies that hit different as a parent, this is definitely one of them. Both Case and Whitmore, and to a lesser extent Vivica A Fox, they just come across differently, as great parents. On that note...there have been multi-mile wide alien space ships hovering over American cities for a day, they have obliterated New York, DC, LA, Atlanta, and others...you are literally about to send a squadron of volunteer amateur pilots to fight them...why is the god damn Colonel from Area 51 giving Russell side eye when he tells them he was abducted by aliens 10 years ago?

- President Whitmore ""I have a beautiful, young, brunette in bed with me"". His wife ""Her!?!"" Once you see that its Mae Whitman, your eyes lock onto her everytime just expecting her to do something quirky and cute like make a mayonegg.

- Dr Oakenshits or whatever is wildly irresponsible. They have this ship and 3 cadavers for 40 years, and Whitmore is right - they've done absolutely nothing and learned even less about them in that time. Then, he gets a new subject, who's merely unconscious (confirmed, not dead) and does a casual autopsy with little more that a face mask for protection. The same aliens who were wiping them out without breaking a sweat. THERE WERE ROBOTS IN 1996, IM SURE THEY HAD SOME AT AREA FUCKING 51. The part i don't see get mentioned much is how...advanced that alien is. Pay attention and you'll see he's manipulating Oakenshits voice box, forcing him to talk (way back I just assumed it was the telepathy they referenced earlier).

- Vivicas titanic thunder thigh problem. So, i dont have the math, but stay with me. This gigantic warship, that is several miles wide, produces a beam of pure energy that wipes out a 1,000 foot tall building in an instant. This strike produces a concussive blast that wipes out the entirety of New York City and greater Los Angeles (or at least what looks to be several miles wide radii). Viv sees this happening from her car, struggles out of the seat, throws a few bags out the back seat, grabs her son, and is able to run 50 yards or so, kick open a maintenance door, all in time to not just avoid the concussive blast, but call to the dog. The dog I can get...but Will Smith literally calls her ""chicken legs"" earlier in the film.

- This kid man...he's going through the rubble in the background, picking up random toys and collecting them. How far away are the kids who used to own them? He does this repeatedly in quick glances. THESE ARE NOT HIS TOYS, those were in the car that was obliterated.

- Where did the dog shit? It's not an inconsequential question. Think about how dogs react to fireworks. This dog was in the middle of a nuclear alien assault, then transported to Area 51. He clearly wouldn't have been allowed outside during the attack. Did they just...put him in with the now-dead alien?

- Think youve had a bad day? Imagine how many supervisors were crawling up that alien longshoremans ass after he tractor beamed in a foreign craft that hadnt been seen in 40 years and then a virus was detected coming from his quadrant (well, prior to having a several ton warhead fired up his ass). We see a supervisor literally coming to check in on him (and presumably be the 20th person give him shit about his mistake) as the warhead goes off.

- So, Whitmore...he was a Gulf War pilot. Clearly, the Uber ecohippie who suckerpunched him didnt vote for him. Vivica (a low income stripper with a heart of gold single mother) says she ""voted for the other guy""...just *how* upset would he have been that New York and LA were obliterated...California and New York are now swing states (im ignoring ID4.2)

- The random guy in the Harley hat, who's part of the volunteer airmen. The camera has him just off center constantly, he's high fiving, he's almost in focus. And yet... he gets 0 lines and is one of our key identifiers of that group. Comes across weird to me, like they wanted him to be distinct, but didnt have anything for him to do.

Anyways, Happy 4th, and do not go quietly into the night.","[""I fly\n\nI'm pilot"", 'One military plane collided with a spaceship?
