1lsr9p6,midjourney,Looking for a truly high-quality AI tool to turn photos into realistic oil paintings,"I’ve tested a ton of AI tools that claim to turn photos into oil paintings, from the free apps to the premium ones, and honestly, I'm very frustrated. They all promise to keep the original likeness, personality, and feel of the subject, but they don’t. What I end up with is a heavily stylized, generic face that barely resembles the original photo. It’s like the AI replaces the person instead of transforming them. What I’m really looking for is a tool that can turn an existing photo into a realistic, textured oil painting (not just a cheesy filter). Maintain 100% facial likeness, expression, structure, mood, etc. Preserve personality and subtle details (not smoothing everything into plastic). Looks like it was painted by hand, as if a real artist painted it in oil on canvas. It'd be nice to have some control over style. I'm looking for a tool that works especially well with portraits.

If anyone knows of an advanced tool, I’d love to hear about it. Not looking for the usual “photo-to-painting” gimmicks. I want something that genuinely feels like an oil painting and respects the subject.

See the examples of what I'm looking for below:

1lsafuo,midjourney,(Midjourney + Photoshop) Artist,"Hi guys, I'm Eric. I'm a Graphic Designer gone Photoshop Collage Artist who has been using Midjourney to generate my stock photography for the last 4 years, I simply ask for an image of let's say a 'fighter jet on a black background' (the top left), or a skeleton in a red hoodie on a blue background, and then I trace it and cut it out using photoshop, and that's where the fun begins..

When I was first starting to learn photoshop, I could've mastered it much quicker if I had the tools that we have today.. for example: I ask ChatGPT for critiques and help with bringing ideas to life, I've also been talking to CGPT about After Effects, it's enormously helpful with creating loops and getting to know the program inside and out. I've integrated Midjourney into almost all of my workflow now because of how much better it is at creating high resolution images of exactly what I'm looking for. I started teaching myself photoshop \~14 years ago.. and I have made more technical progress in the last 4 years than I did in the first 10 years.

There's a long way to go still to get to where I want to be, but, I think with the tools coming out of Midjourney, like video, I could learn after effects and bring these pieces to life using video and motion.

* prompt engineering is not easy, there are LOTS of tweaks and hacks you'll need to do get a decent shot
* biggest hurdle i see is lack of consistent character/world generation and limited options available to allow me as a creative to control the scene
* i think a software that combined end to end execution from script to visual storyboarding to generation to editing/export might be really beneficial
* it's still a bit expensive, i burnt through my credits pretty quickly because of too much experimenting and trying to get that ""perfect"" shot. i had to settle for good shots in the end instead of trying for the perfect shot
* overall, very bullish on AI generated films in the future. gonna lead to creative explosion and so many possibilities!
* another viewpoint, if you think AI won't take your programming jobs then you should also be of the viewpoint that AI won't take away the creatives job because fundamentally both the things aren't very different!
* would to chat with people who are building something in this domain!

There’s something oddly addictive about reimagining fashion campaigns for collections that have just walked the runway. Especially when the ideas come rushing in fully formed—visually rich, conceptually sharp, and honestly… shootable.

As I’ve said before, MidJourney is not a shortcut, nor a substitute for real creative work. It’s a playground, a tool that helps refine what’s already simmering in your mind. It’s a way to build a visual skeleton, to test a mood, a tension, a composition.

Of course, nothing replaces the magic of being on set: real models breathing in real clothes, a camera in your hand, the unexpected thrill of the imperfect. Or in this case… a neon-lit diorama and a snarling taxidermy wolf. (Still waiting for that moment IRL, lol.)

This time, it was the Marc Jacobs FW26 collection that got stuck in my head. There’s something about the silhouettes, the eerie elegance, the contradictions and glamour, predator and pose that felt just too cinematic to ignore.

I worked with a label developer a while back that created the 19 crimes campaign. If you’re not familiar, they were AR enabled graphics on the wine labels that would tell you a story about the person on each label when you pointed your phone at it.

I work for a clothing company, we use MJ to build assets for our tshirt designs. I would like to try something similar, adding an AR function to each tshirt graphic that plays a generated animation of the design. Like a generated race car driving right out of the shirt when your phone scans the image.

I am guessing the original developer used a proprietary app. I am wondering if anyone can suggest a workflow that might let me do this with freely available tools or things that might already be installed on a users phone. I am hoping they can see the animations right in the store without having to purchase or install an app.

TITLE: “Museum of Unnatural History”
Went to the real one in NYC and was thinking:: 'You know what'd be rad??'

Jarred horrors, bottled gods, and creatures that slipped through the cracks of reality--
Admission is free. Sanity costs extra.

The bones still twitch.
The water still whispers.
The lights never turn off.

Welcome to the Museum of Unnatural History\~
Please do not tap the glass.
It taps back.

※◉ ALGO-AUTOPSY ◉ ※

This is was a pretty straightforward workflow:
Midjourney → Veo 2 → After Effects → Your eyeballs.

Idea→Done = 72 hours

Surprise twist, damn Veo 3 sucked on these things. Kept tryna make ‘em photorealistic but instead looked like caca. Got frisky with Veo 2 (fast) - which is great because it’s like 10c a gen or whatever.

I put all the sound in, little spooky growls n' shit in the background. Echoing footsteps in hushed rooms for the vibes.

꧁ ⟡ SIDE NOTE FROM THE PRESENT PAST⟡ ꧂
Paying by the generation is the modern equivalent of paying for minutes on your cell phone.
Gonna be hilarious one day\~

Come find me on insta\~ I'm looking for film friends who aren't terrified of the future!

I'll hand off prompts and techniques free.
Slop together. Die alone.

1lpvpze,midjourney,Counting down to half a million images,"When I first started in Midjourney, I remember a coworker coming to me all excited, but also disappointed, because Midjourney had just opened up their website for downloads and curation of your image libraries. He loved the idea, but he had maybe 800 images in total, and they required 1,000 before giving you entry.

I was surprised to hear he had only done that many because he joined weeks before I did. He must have seen something in my face because he paused and said, ""Wait, have you done 1,000 images already?""

I just told him, ""Yes, I have."" I didn't tell him I had already passed 10,000 images and was well on my way to 20,000.

Here's the thing. I have mild aphantasia, a very limited ability to visualize things, especially imaginary things. I also have a deep love of art and fantasy, which makes this particular limitation really frustrating.

Midjourney opened my eyes, literally. Suddenly, I could see anything I could imagine, and I have an almost limitless imagination. I went to town. I would pull my phone out everywhere and type in some new idea, just to see what it would look like. Then I'd do 100 variants, just to see it in more colors. I would wake up in the middle of the night just to see more. It wasn't just fun, it was like being given sight after being blind my entire life.

Now, on top of being a fantasy nerd and a lover of images, I'm also a coder, so I weaponized whimsy and figured out new ways to generate prompts that generated even better art. One thing led to another and here I stand on the mountain of 498,000+ images as of July 2, 2025. Ask me tomorrow and it will be higher.

Most days I run through a couple thousand images, although one glorious day in December 2024, I created over 18,000 images in one afternoon. Yeah, good times.

1lpov8q,midjourney,Question about consistency with all these models.,"Now I have absolutely no experience with AI content creation in general. I’ve mad the occasional video or image but didn’t really get into it like some of the people in here other AI subreddits. But I was browsing around and had a question that I couldn’t really get the answer to. But I feel like there’s should be a reason people aren’t doing this. Maybe I’m overestimating the AI.

 But I saw there was an AI capable of making scenes from 2d to 3d. Couldn’t you basically grab a screen grab from a different angle, or even a different position of the same character and the use image to video for midjourney or similar video generating platforms. That way you get a lot of consistency for one scenario. I feel like it’s something that just makes sense to me, but I couldn’t personally try it out. But maybe there’s someone out there that knows why this isn’t or is possible. Maybe the tool I mentioned isn’t accessible or doesn’t actually work the way I think it does. But it just feels like you could make some really good with the angles of that. Like just starting with something like midjourney, then proceed to make it a video and make it 3d to get a different angle at the last frame. But as I write this another question pops up as for the limitations of video generation. I mean couldn’t you technically use the same video over and over by using the last frame and telling it do something else or does it come out differently. Like if you use an image then into a video and use the last frame for the next video and so on. Not talking about extending it, but after you finished extending as there’s limit to how much you can extend it. But you could extend it even more with a final frame?

And I ask all this because maybe it’s possible and people are keeping it hidden. Most of the AI films or videos I’ve seen recently are very inconsistent or try to avoid the same scenario and just keeps bouncing from scenario to scenario with like a voiceover to keep the film consistent. Like there’s nothing that has really wowed me quite yet.",[],[],1,1,0.66,AI Video - Midjourney,1751438295.0
