1lsafuo,midjourney,(Midjourney + Photoshop) Artist,"Hi guys, I'm Eric. I'm a Graphic Designer gone Photoshop Collage Artist who has been using Midjourney to generate my stock photography for the last 4 years, I simply ask for an image of let's say a 'fighter jet on a black background' (the top left), or a skeleton in a red hoodie on a blue background, and then I trace it and cut it out using photoshop, and that's where the fun begins..

When I was first starting to learn photoshop, I could've mastered it much quicker if I had the tools that we have today.. for example: I ask ChatGPT for critiques and help with bringing ideas to life, I've also been talking to CGPT about After Effects, it's enormously helpful with creating loops and getting to know the program inside and out. I've integrated Midjourney into almost all of my workflow now because of how much better it is at creating high resolution images of exactly what I'm looking for. I started teaching myself photoshop \~14 years ago.. and I have made more technical progress in the last 4 years than I did in the first 10 years.

There's a long way to go still to get to where I want to be, but, I think with the tools coming out of Midjourney, like video, I could learn after effects and bring these pieces to life using video and motion.

1ls3k8a,midjourney,Anitya – A Fully AI-Generated Short Film (MidJourney + GPT),"A few thoughts after working on this project:

* prompt engineering is not easy, there are LOTS of tweaks and hacks you'll need to do get a decent shot
* biggest hurdle i see is lack of consistent character/world generation and limited options available to allow me as a creative to control the scene
* i think a software that combined end to end execution from script to visual storyboarding to generation to editing/export might be really beneficial
* it's still a bit expensive, i burnt through my credits pretty quickly because of too much experimenting and trying to get that ""perfect"" shot. i had to settle for good shots in the end instead of trying for the perfect shot
* overall, very bullish on AI generated films in the future. gonna lead to creative explosion and so many possibilities!
* another viewpoint, if you think AI won't take your programming jobs then you should also be of the viewpoint that AI won't take away the creatives job because fundamentally both the things aren't very different!
* would to chat with people who are building something in this domain!

There’s something oddly addictive about reimagining fashion campaigns for collections that have just walked the runway. Especially when the ideas come rushing in fully formed—visually rich, conceptually sharp, and honestly… shootable.

As I’ve said before, MidJourney is not a shortcut, nor a substitute for real creative work. It’s a playground, a tool that helps refine what’s already simmering in your mind. It’s a way to build a visual skeleton, to test a mood, a tension, a composition.

Of course, nothing replaces the magic of being on set: real models breathing in real clothes, a camera in your hand, the unexpected thrill of the imperfect. Or in this case… a neon-lit diorama and a snarling taxidermy wolf. (Still waiting for that moment IRL, lol.)

This time, it was the Marc Jacobs FW26 collection that got stuck in my head. There’s something about the silhouettes, the eerie elegance, the contradictions and glamour, predator and pose that felt just too cinematic to ignore.

1lrxnh8,midjourney,19 crimes style graphic tee?,"This isn’t strictly a Midjourney question but I’m not sure where to start.

I worked with a label developer a while back that created the 19 crimes campaign. If you’re not familiar, they were AR enabled graphics on the wine labels that would tell you a story about the person on each label when you pointed your phone at it.

I work for a clothing company, we use MJ to build assets for our tshirt designs. I would like to try something similar, adding an AR function to each tshirt graphic that plays a generated animation of the design. Like a generated race car driving right out of the shirt when your phone scans the image.

I am guessing the original developer used a proprietary app. I am wondering if anyone can suggest a workflow that might let me do this with freely available tools or things that might already be installed on a users phone. I am hoping they can see the animations right in the store without having to purchase or install an app.

Thanks if you can help.",[],[],0,0,0.5,Question - Midjourney AI,1751675965.0

1lrv6a0,midjourney,Any advice to get images similar to what I’m looking for?,"For a test run/first design, I want a design of a knucklehead motor (specific kind of motor from Harley-Davidson), and only the motor.

I’ve tried several different prompts. For example:

“Knucklehead Harley-Davidson motor. Design of knucklehead engine with two cylinders, chrome. No background. Engine has the distinctive rocker boxes that signify the era of the EL Harley-Davidson, beginning in 1936. This needs the rocker boxes at the top of the cylinders to match the knucklehead design from Harley-Davidson.

I also attached an image of the motor I’m looking for first image prompts.

It’s not understanding what I’m looking for. It’s providing engines that don’t look anything like a Harley v-twin.

Also seems like it retains no memory between prompts, other than variations. I would like to be able to add comments between variations, because the variations get no closer to what I’m looking for.

Not sure how else to express the kind of motor I’m looking for.
