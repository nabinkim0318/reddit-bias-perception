1ly0bbh,Keep trying to hold on but I don’t think I going to make it through,I have been dealing with depression for a long time and it seems like it’s gotten worse since I moved to a new city and working a new job for two years now. My life seems to be falling apart and everyone hates me. I keep trying to fight for my dreams but honestly I can’t take it anymore and don’t want to do it anymore. I just want to give up on both myself and my dreams. It’s not worth it anymore.,1752326431.0,1,1

1lxzmf9,He thinks weed is a crutch.,"I have ptsd from being raped by my ex and the guy I'm currently seeing constantly talks down on weed and people who use it.

 It's me. I'm people who use it. I tried to explain it to him but it seems like no matter what he doesn't want to hear it. And regardless sticks to his opinion....as if there isn't any nuance to be had. Sometimes I think I'd be better off completely alone so no one could make me feel so inferior. Would he feel differently if I was sober and physically self harming? Would that finally show him the benefits of being medicated... ",1752324415.0,3,1
1lxz1dy,I won't make it,"I have no energy to type out coherently so I apologise

I have extremely abusive parents. They hate each other and they hate me. They have arguments with all family so no one talks to them. Neither of them have any friends. Not even one. My mother is a covert narcissist and my dad is extremely controlling and abusive too but in a much more roundabout way so it's not always easy to tell. They have isolated me my whole life. At 15 they forced me into this school that was preparing for engineering 6 days a week 9 hours a day. I used to love extracurriculars before that and it all stopped. It was all just study. I would sob to my parents to take me out and had no friends no life and I hated engineering. My mom called me a failure and a loser daily. My dad would pretend to understand in the moment but tell me I was dramatic. I had to do engineering after that for other reasons. Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to attend college. I had to take a gap year because my depression left my grades to the level where even the worst universities wouldn't take me.


I had decided my date of k*lling myself. 2 months before that date I went on this trip our university organised before the first semester had even started. I met a guy there and we clicked. He was the most understanding beautiful person I had ever met in my life. When my parents would abuse me I would have panic attacks so bad my entire body would start shaking so hard I wouldn't be able to pick things up. So I would just wear my jeans and with no money or anything in my hands run away to him. He would take me for drives or to McDonald's and we would eat. He would be with me as long as I wanted. I had terrible depression and suicidal ideation and he would talk me off the ledge. He would stay with me on calls because my anxiety was so so terrible staying at home. On our 6 month anniversary I saw so many accounts and pictures and videos of naked women. I cried so so hard and he did too he apologised and was very sincere about it so I believed him. 2 years in I found out he had a horrible porn addiction. I went numb he apologised again gave me paragraph on paragraph on why he's a horrible person. I believed him again. He was perfect my literal knight in shining armor. He had a close female friend who had a crush on him since the beginning but he would shut her off completely and when I told him she liked him he went low contact. Almost 3 years in I found out he was texting her and hiding it from me. They would send each other view once photos and he would tell her stuff he never told me. I made him block her and he would fucking sms her. We have broken up finally because I found more stuff which wasn't sexual but he would tell her to come over to visit his mom's house since they're neighbors ig.


I can't live I am not properly able to explain it here since I just told you what happened. All of my self esteem is because of him. All that I am is because of him. I have horrible horrible parents no family or siblings I do have good friends but they are not him. They just don't understand me the way he does. They're still close to me but it's him. I am alive every single day because of him. This man would literally bring me meals sometimes and feed me. I would tell him every day how much I appreciated him I would do so much stuff for him plan dates tell him every way possible that he was the love of my life. That I would give up my life in a second to keep him alive. I thought I owed him my life so I would make sure I did everything in my power to make him feel loved and happy.


How do I get over this? I used to beg the universe to give me a sign before. He was my miracle I would even brag about him to people I just met. I can't stay alive. This is my letter. I will be moving abroad next month and everyone keeps telling me it's my fresh start but it's not. I will be more lonely than ever in a foreign country. He was my reason. Why would he do this? I can't be alive. ",1752322610.0,1,0

went to the hospital in feb but they had no room in ANY local inpatient facility so i had to go to iop/php. all they did was diagnose me w adhd (on top of the mdd gad osdd ptsd i already have) tell me informally i probably had ocd and autism, then sent me on my way w anxiety meds that have long since stopped working bc they were the starting doses and i have treatment resistant issues.
i can't pay my bills bc i can't work or drive and idk wtf i'm doing when it comes to applying for SSI tho i'm trying when possible. i want to experience the joy and beauty of life but every day feels the same and i can't get out of this myself and i don't have anyone irl who can help. been feeling like i'm just completely incompatible w this life i've been given and the only way i can fix it is to start over from scratch completely.
if it were up to me i'd have put myself down ages ago. i'm only here bc i haven't died or been killed yet, attempting is too risky bc i can't get hospitalized again, and bc some ppl would miss me despite everything. long rambly post but i don't have many other outlets lol",1752322240.0,1,0

1lxyghp,10 years ago I used to post a lot here...,"I was a lot younger back then. I am 30 now. I managed to turn my life around. I have a well payed job at a big company, with interesting and varied tasks. I am well respected (although people overestimate my abilites). I have a lot of friends, a very close friends cicle. I also am somewhat friends with a lot of peopel at work. No financial worries. A big flat in a nice city that I can easily affort. No big traumas from my childhood, a loving mother and sister...

Yet I am bag in this hole. I was struggling a lot over the last 2 years, but I was thinking I get through this. I fell in love with a woman a few weeks ago. The fourth time in my entire life, although it was never a pleasent experience. In turns out she is in a relationship. I should be happy that I still have a great connection to a new friend that I like a lot, and the feelings are also gone... but with those... I dont know... with those that little spark that was inside me, that tiny vunlerable flame... its gone. Exinguished. I dont know why. It was probably a terrible timing to fall in love with anyone since I was far from being mentally healthy.

It's the worst thing I ever felt. I'm just crying all day. I couldn't cope with his violent behaviours. I broke up with him and had several relationships but nothing came close. Since then he is medicated and is going through a proper diagnosis for BPD/Bipolar II. After our break up he begged for me to stay for months but I said I couldn't because he hasn't changed. Then he married someone else. He still has feelings for me and I do too, I don't know what to do and I'm heartbroken.

1lxxrw6,I don't know how to live like a person,"No one likes me and I've even gotten so desperate as to ask and here are the leading contenders as to why:

""You are a drunk""

""You do drugs""

""You are the worst person I know""

I'm not fully sure how I'm the worst, because I truly love everyone I meet. Even in brief interactions, everything anyone tells me I truly care about, and anything they need help with I would bend over backwards to help them. I only act mean and tough when I feel like people are being mean to me, so I need to act like their words don't phase me, and like I'm strong and totally capable and that their criticisms don't get to me. The drinking and drug things though, I use drinking as a crutch because I really don't like to carry the burden of being bored and sad and self loathing, and alcohol makes it feel better. I sometimes use drugs when I'm in a good mood, because it makes me feel like a happy human being, and sometimes I'll use acid because it makes me self actualize and realize the situation I'm in but in a neutral light, instead of the usual self deprecating light I see myself in.

But after all, no matter what, I am just a worthless alcoholic druggie. I try to justify it but it just makes me feel worse, because how else can I justify it aside from ""I just use it to feel happy because I'm generally a sad, lonely piece of shit"". I know everyone's lonely and no one's truly happy and yada yada yada, this is the kind of shit everyone tells me but I ask how they cope and it just seems the exact same. ""Food"", ""Sex"", ""Hobbies"". Food makes me feel fat and ugly, sex makes me feel dirty, and I can't find anything I truly like because I'm so exhausted and everything is so tiresome. Some people will tell me ""Oh, friends and family make it all worth it"", well my whole family doesn't like me, and I can't form a genuine connection with anyone. I'm a one-man-army and I seem to be fucking losing.

I'm probably the problem, I keep making mistakes, intentionally and unintentionally. I steal, lie, do drugs, get drunk, have shitty sex, and no matter what I still feel completely empty. The idea of ""happiness"" keeps me going, but I'm so far and drifting further that it's just a weird dream. Nostalgic flashbacks to happy memories keep getting more and more vague. A few months ago I'd fall asleep to vivid flashbacks of playing video games with my family, going on vacations, and fun times with friends and family, then those stopped working so my brain started throwing me memories of just sleeping in a nice, comfy bed, hanging out with my cats, and car rides with my dad, but now my ""happy memories"" are ""REMEMBER WHEN YOU HAD A JOB YOU COULD HALF TOLERATE AND PEOPLE YOU KNOW SMILED AT YOU?!"" because my brain seems to just keep desperately trying to pump any semblance of serotonin at me.



Anyway, in short, I feel like a loser, no one likes me, and nothing makes me happy because I have nothing. Everything is just a disappointment.  Something will make me feel good for a second, and I latch onto it for as long as I can, but ultimately I am hollow. I have no future, no present, and the past isn't showing me anymore pleasant flashbacks. I don't know, I just want to stay happy, but happiness lives in the past, and I reminisce while stoned, drunk, or high on drugs and If I'm not any of the 3 I'm completely numb. I don't think it was the drugs that made me feel this way, I think rather it was that all my good memories were associated with it. My brother and I, high and drunk in the basement, chatting all night long and listening to music, and then he told me ""by the way I fucking hate you"" and now even when I'm sober I feel hated. I don't know. I'm a mess. I drink a lot now, I never used to but I'm old enough to buy it so it's so easy now. I used to just ride it out until I can get drunk, but now I'm drunk until I have to ride it out.



Fuck, I'm fucked right now. This has been a stream of consciousness post but anyway I just need something, or someone to save me, or I need the strength to save myself. Maybe I need God or some shit. I don't know. I'm in a deep, dark, hole but being out of it is so empty and lonely. Drugs and alcohol feel like my friend but they don't stick around long enough. No one does. I can't be alone in my head, I'm miserable. I want to be loved by everyone.

I was experiencing blunting, losing sensation down there, and I couldn’t finish in bed. I felt like I was losing my humanity.

When i was a child, my parents punished me, whenever i showed emotions. Mostly i was in anger,  and they ignored it, laughed about it, showed me that they are stronger than me and my anger is totally senseless.
I am not allowed to have emotions, i will not be heard, not be seen, i will be completely lonely. Till this day, i have this inner believing, and i am not able to communicate my emotions without beeing ashamed.

But i wanna praise my emotions, espacially my anger, but i dont know how, everytime i try to get in touch with anything, sadness, anger, shame, it just swims away like a school of fish.

How do you feel about that? Have you found a way to get in touch with your anger? And how did u do it?
I do really apreciate it if u have read til here and i am looking forward for your response.
And sorry for Bad english, not native:D",1752308810.0,5,2
1lxvfkr,I want to drop out of life,"VENT.
Cbf typing it all out in detail but basically. I'm late 20s. My first attempt was in school, about the age of 8 or 9. 20 years on... I wish id been successful.

- I'm continuously overwhelmed by the crushing weight of life, overpriced rent, food, sanitary items, clothing...
- I keep being deadnamed and getting called ma'am or she just because I have long hair atm
- I couldn’t get a job out of uni, i can't get a job in uni
- uni itself is soul-crushing, even the subjects I like i struggle with academically
- I've tried therapy many times, hotlines, self help books and aps, never looking for a cure but a just little stabilisation, but nothing
- my dad is one of those ""suicide is selfish/for the cowards"" kinda guys, we never really got on so dont pity me lol, even though he knows my best friend (fiancé) did it, as well as a few friends and family
- I had a nightmare about my abuser/sa last last year and am on edge more
- I really like movies and tv shows but everytime I see a happy character it hits me like a brick that ill never have anything like that, it makes me physically ill. I've thrown up from the stress.
- I'm struggling with anxiety attacks every week, I've tried messaging but they never help (even after months/years
- struggling financially (not close with family etc to ask for a loan or help getting on my feet)
- I really wanted to do well in my career and help people but everything I do backfires in one way or another
- my flatmates give me sensory overload even though very told them (they're men)
- I'm disgusted at what i see in the mirror (im fit and toned but idk i just hate what i see)
- I'm too much, and not enough
- someone in one of my uni classes keeps reporting me for no reason, i used to be bullied in school and its feeling like that all over again.
- I feel physical pain that no doctors have ever helped with, they play it off as part of my asthma since it's mostly in my chest, it's worse when I'm sad especially in my chest and arms but Dr google said that's just the depression.

I wanted to live but life doesn't want me. I swear I tried, I had so many ideas of what to do but. I'm so tired, physically, mentally, I've gone for a walk, drank water, had a shower... I still feel like this. All the time.

I dont reckon anyone will read this but if anyone does, please tell me if I'm crazy for wanting the pain to stop, or please send me a picture of a cat or something idk",1752308761.0,7,1
1lxvege,Why is someone who has everything still depressed?,"I'm sorry if what I’m about to say sounds insensitive, but let’s say I have a friend named Tom. Tom has everything people usually want in life: his parents are wealthy and financially successful, they live in a big house in a gated neighborhood, and his family is kind and loving. Tom went to a private boarding school and then a top-30 university after graduation. He’s well-educated, tall, and handsome, and he has a lot of women interested in him. He has a nice corporate job in investment banking. He has everything.

But what puzzles me is that he told me he’s depressed - that he feels life is meaningless. That confuses me, because here we have Tom, someone who seems to have everything on the outside. So how come he’s still depressed and finds life lacking meaning?",1752308635.0,22,47
1lxvbmb,What's the point of all this?,"On Saturdays and Sundays, I never have anything to do. I go out and wander aimlessly. I've been in the car, stuck in a parking lot for over an hour. I don't know what to do, I don't know where to go.

I'm no longer a kid; so many doors have closed; I'm completely alone at an age where being alone is a curse: without friends, without family, without ties.
It's strange how time passes, the suffocating speed with which the seasons fade; how quickly good intentions, acquaintances, and plans for the future arise and die. It seems like only yesterday that I was 15, full of life, full of dreams, full of hopes. ""When I grow up, I'll do this!"" I told myself.

Shortly afterward, you find yourself having to adjust your course, under the weight of changing circumstances and a family that created you only to pass on unresolved traumas: ""When I grow up, I won't do exactly that, but it will still be worth it,"" I told myself. Only to then lower my expectations again. And then again, and again, and again: the new low becomes too lofty an ambition, unattainable, and in a sort of endless downward spiral, we find ourselves forced to aim for unimaginable depths.

At the end of the day, what remains? Living simply to exist? It's been clear to me for some time now that I'm not here to enjoy the luxury of a normal life, which I've long sought but never achieved. So what? Everything seems ridiculously pointless.",1752308308.0,5,0

When I first started therapy and medication, even I had opinions about whether they could even change anything. As much as I didn’t believe that by talking about my feelings to someone and taking these happy pills every day would eventually make everything go away, I still gave it a shot. I had nothing to lose &amp; if we’re being honest, I grew a sense of hope that one day all of this could go away, &amp; I wouldn’t feel that emptiness anymore. This went on for a few years. From changing prescriptions to trying alternative methods or something as simple as picking up a hobby to get my mind off things. I gave it all a shot because I wanted to feel like I could finally live my life for myself &amp; not for my mother. That’s a concept on its own that a lot of people don’t understand. How I see things right now, I am only here because I’m waiting for my mom to die. If she didn’t give a shit about me, I would’ve exited a long time ago. You know it’s really sick and dark? There would be days when I would hope for my mother to die soon so that way I could die too. Imagine waking up feeling like that and then spending that same day with your mother with that mentality. Truly try to imagine that... It’s fucking sick, dude. It is the most disgusting thing I’ve ever heard and yet I do it. Say it. We all know what I am. Just a worthless piece of shit that deserves to be gutted and thrown in the trash.

Regardless, that safety net was placed exactly where it needed to be placed, and it did its job very very well. And I went through some stooooopid shit that I guess you could tell everybody else goes through in life during their teenage years. But because of that net, I pushed through it.

But all that’s changed. I reached a point where I thought I could never reach. One thing led to another a couple of weeks ago and when I tell you that it was bad, I mean it was bad. It was almost as if I was on auto pilot. I went straight to my medicine cabinet, grabbed all my medication, grabbed a big cup and filled it with water… and then I stood there and I asked myself am I really about to cross that line… am I ready to do this? I know this is what I want, but am I ready to end my suffering and start my mother’s?… And what kills me the most is that in  those very last seconds before popping all the pills, I was basically saying I don’t care about anyone nor do I care about their feelings nor do I care about what they’re gonna go through and that’s includes my mother. What I did instead was put my wants &amp; needs first for the first time ever. Am I wrong for doing that? Is it wrong to choose yourself in your own happiness first instead of others? I know this sounds stupid, but I really wanted to set me free. I wanted to make everything go away forever because for the longest time ever, I really felt like the longer I stay, the crazier I’m gonna go.

As you can tell, the pills did not work. I woke up extremely nauseous, dizzy, unable to stay balanced, especially when I walked around. I threw up all day and almost in every throw up sesh, pills came out. It was truly one of the worst experience of my life and I just find it funny because that wasn’t really the plan lol and I also told myself that I am so pathetic that I can’t even achieve taking my own life haha

As the title suggests, I believe I have cracked. Because I had a second suicide attempt a couple of days after that and the only reason that I didn’t go through with it was because someone had called the police on me because they heard that I was going through the motions that night &amp; so they showed up at my door wanting to talk. I will say this is not my first time dealing with police when I’m going through something so I simply answered them in the most cookie cut way so that way they would leave me alone.

After they left, I didn’t try to harm myself again, but the damage had been done. I’m not saying I’m gonna go kill myself after this post, so please don’t tell anyone because I am just trying to express something that I rarely get to express. My only fear now is that if it’s not today, it could be tomorrow or next week or next month. That promise I made for my mother is no longer valid. &amp; it really does kill me because it’s not that I don’t love my mother. It’s just that I can’t take this anymore. I want to be free. I can’t take this life anymore. I deserve to be happy &amp; if it’s not here then it’ll be somewhere else far far away. I just hope that when it does happen that there is no mess and that I truly truly hope my mother can forgive me for abandoning her.",1752292748.0,2,0

Someone crashed into my mother's car when we were driving to go out of town. The people provided insurance/id and we filed a claim with their insurance. But they did not report a claim on their insurance despite having worse damage on their car and they are not picking up the phone when their insurance calls them so things are at a stop. We still went on the two day trip in my car cause I had paid for the hotel already. Now to make things worse we came back and my brother almost immediately runs away from home. He suffers from mental illness. He tends to do this at least once a year for the past few years and my parents are so scared and looking for them in the streets. They are older people so I worry for them. But I feel I bring them bad luck or make things go worse for them so I'm just staying away from that for now. I just hate that bad things happen to good people like my mom. It also doesn't help that my psychiatrist moved so I don't have one now and can't ask for a short term anxiolytic for times like this. Everything just sucks. I'm trying to watch this new show I like and forget everything happening right now but I can't.

1lwytk5,I think my time is up…,"That line, I said, I would never cross is gone. I always told myself that I would never attempt suicide because I refused to put my mom through that. The last thing I ever wanted for her was to bury her own child. That pain that only I could imagine, is the reason that I’ve been here for so long. No matter what life threw at me, I kept it together, because deep inside I knew that all it could take was one bad evening.

I will say I really did try to take any other route but suicide. As much as I didn’t believe in happy pills &amp; the whole concept of mental health, I gave it a shot. I had nothing to lose &amp; if we’re being honest, I grew a sense of hope that one day all of this could go away, &amp; I wouldn’t feel that emptiness anymore. This went on for a few years. From changing prescriptions to trying alternative methods or something as simple as picking up a hobby to get my mind off things. I gave it all a shot because I wanted to feel like I could finally live my life for myself &amp; not for my mother. In other words, if my mom were to die, I would want to continue living for myself. Does that make sense?

That was honestly what held it all together. As long as my mother stayed alive, I felt like I could guarantee anyone that would never attempt anything stupid.

But all that’s changed. I reached a point where I thought I could never reach. &amp; what kills me the most is that in those very last seconds before popping all the pills, my mother came into mind, but I didn’t give a shit. I chose myself that night &amp; though it makes sound stupid, I wanted to finally set me free. I wanted to make everything go away forever because it really did feel like life was a living hell that I could never. I figured anywhere is better than.

As you can tell, the pills did not work. I woke up extremely nauseous, dizzy, unable to stay balanced, especially when I walked around. I threw up all day and almost in every throw up sesh, pills came out. It was truly one of the worst experience of my life and I just find it funny because that wasn’t really the plan lol and I also told myself that I am so pathetic that I can’t even achieve taking my own life haha

As the title suggests, I believe I have cracked. Because I had a second suicide attempt a couple of days after that &amp; the only reason that I didn’t go through with it was because someone had called the police on me because they heard that I was going through the motions that night &amp; so they showed up at my door wanting to talk. I will say this is not my first time dealing with police when I’m going through something so I simply answered them in the most cookie cut way so that way they would leave me alone.

After they left, I didn’t try to harm myself again, but the damage had been done. I’m not saying I’m gonna go kill myself after this post, so please don’t tell anyone because I am just trying to express something that I rarely get to express. My only fear now is that if it’s not today, it could be tomorrow or next week or next month. That promise I made for my mother is no longer valid. &amp; it really does kill me because it’s not that I don’t love my mother. It’s just that I can’t take this anymore. I want to be free. I can’t take this life anymore. I deserve to be happy &amp; if it’s not here then it’ll be somewhere else far far away.

1lxkjy7,"I haven’t shared my experience with anyone, absolutely no one, until this post.","Hey guys,

I’m sorry this is a long read but you might find it inspiring or relatable. My recent experience with depression was incredibly difficult, terrorizing, traumatic, but also changed me…

A quick history of my self. I’m a single 39 year old man that has battle substance abuse since my early 20s.

I have always used to slow down a racing mind, “self medicating” they call it. I was diagnosed with ADHD type I in my mid 30s.

5 years ago I finally got clean of a really bad benzodiazepine and alcohol addiction. I’ve always been a very high functioning addict, but the dosages and combination of these two just made that not possible.

Thanks to an amazing hospital staff, rehab staff, and my family I got through it. I enjoyed two years of sobriety, but like a lot of people that go through this I didn’t come to terms with the fact that I can’t enjoy some things in life like other people can if you catch my drift.

So I relapsed, I started drinking beer again, it obviously started slow, but over the years it got worse. I could still work, but looking back it was wearing me down.

I got laid off from a software development job seven months ago. I was devastated as job interviews and searching is very stressful for me, especially in today’s market.

While freshly laid off and drinking too much one night, I did cocaine for the first time. It was obviously a huge mistake, but one that was made. I loved it, I was calm and confident, awake, I could socialize, and my pool game was amazing.

My use over the months kept getting more and more frequent. If I had more than 3+ tall boys, there was no stopping me from getting blow.

Durning that time I hooked up with a woman I have been in love with for five years, but it was never the right time. It started off wonderful and I’ve never felt like that with anyone and it was so mutual.

But my impulsiveness got worse, my drinking got worse, and the cocaine use got really bad.

My use was having huge influences on my emotions, my personality, my priorities, and so much more.

Before all the drinking had its influences but cocaine took it to other level. Cocaine brings out the worst in people and it definitely brought the worst out in me.

The relationship with that woman collapsed because I had turned into this egomaniac, overconfident, and just a huge piece of shit man and person. I was completely oblivious to it all also.

The weekend of the collapse that woman said a lot of things to me, she was angry and heartbroken, and let me have it.

I’m pretty sure I was on coke durning this time, so I was a effing idiot when it came to my reaction, but I listened to it all, all of it.

I was already a little depressed before this because of the lack of dopamine in my brain, but this took it to a new level.

A few days passed after this and I found my self missing her. The drugs and alcohol had really clouded my thoughts.

I found my self for the first time reflecting on what she said and what she brought to my attention. I finally found my self to be able to look at my self from an outside perspective.

That perspective was terrifying, difficult, and just downright heartbreaking.

I had turned into a person and man that is SO far from who I truly am and where I came from.

The feelings just loaded up on me like I’ve never experienced. The amount of guilt, shame, disappointment, and heartbreak loaded on my felt like some one had dropped a cannon ball on my chest. I was so disappointed in myself that I am once again neck deep in substance abuse, no job yet, have been very distant emotional from friends and family, and so much more.

I couldn’t believe it. How could I have been so oblivious this entire time?

I felt absolutely worthless, and that I have become a horrible, horrible person. My family would be so disappointed in me and what I had become.

I just absolutely fell into the darkest depression I have ever experienced, and I tried to run from it by using more drugs and alcohol, which obviously made things worse.

I lost complete control of my thoughts. I immediately started to think about suicide. Which I’ve thought about before in my life, but this went to a whole new level.

This next part has been extremely traumatic for me. As I said I had lost complete control of my thoughts. For a period of almost two months. I would come home alone and begin to lose my mind. I would spend all night and morning with a circle of thoughts on how I should kill my self, why I should, what I would write on my notes and who I would write too.

It was so scary you guys. I could find nothing that would distract my thoughts or hold my attention. 12 to 15 hours of that non stop.

The only breaks I had was to start slamming beers, and that would lead me to getting cocaine. It has gotten so bad that I had no control over my self once those beers were down. It’s hard to explain but a switch would go off and I would go get some subconsciously, like an automated process triggered by a certain event.

I would just do it by my self too, and once it all began to wear off I would fall into my spiral of uncontrollable nonstop suicidal thoughts. This would go on for two months. Days quickly turned into a week, weeks into months, time went by so fast.

I swear the only thing that really stopped me from actually going through one of these plans were two things, first was my little princess, my dog. After every thought I would ask my self? But what about my little girl? No one will probably find me for more than week, she’s going to be so scared and alone, how can I make this work?

Also second, and I learned this from my previous experience with addiction, is that sometimes you just need to take things a day at a time, just one day.


So I would lay there all night and morning telling my self somehow I’m going to get through this, so I should just focus on getting to tomorrow.

I should also add that I was too ashamed, full of guilt, and embarrassed I did this again to ask anyone for help, I did not want to burden my family with my bullshit, I didn’t want to tell my psychiatrist anything because she would just call 911 and put me in a hospital, and I knew then I would get stuck with some huge bill and would get even more depressed…

I tried several times in that period of two months to quit cocaine, but after a few beers that’s impossible.

The next part I still don’t really understand. After all those failed attempts I just kept telling my self “it’s because you aren’t ready, you’ll know when you are.”

I don’t know why or how but one day, I just felt it. I was ready. I am going to do this. I’m going to turn my self around and return to who I truly am.

So I came up with a plan, I’m going to go stay with family, I need to remember who I was, where I came from, who loves me, and who I want to be.

I just told my family I was dealing with some depression and needed to be around family and people for a while. I did not say one word about the substance abuse and horrible thoughts.

I packed my bag, told my dog how much I loved her, and we went to stay with family.

I spent so much time with my mom, my brother and his husband, and my sister and brother in law. I played with my nephews and met my new niece. It was incredibly amazing and exactly what I needed. I started to remember about the loving family I grew up with, the amazing things I’ve accomplished in life despite my addiction problem, and who I am truly am.

I’m a very kind, compassionate, humble, and hilarious man. I’m just full of love and it reflects on my dog.

I spent 10 days with them, and never used at all. I even went to the bar to play pool with the locals and just drank soda..

Those were my only two goals, be with family, and learn how to shoot pool sober. (Pool is a big passion).

That was four weeks ago, and I’m still sober. I’ve come to terms with the fact that I can’t drink period. Never. I have a problem and I finally understand it.

I am a different person now. People have commented on how happy I am, full of energy and life, confident but humble, etc

Unfortunately a few people think I’m being fake, but that’s okay, they don’t under the power of substance abuse and a depressed mind.

However, I quit a 10+ tall boy and a gram a coke everyday habit cold turkey. I credit the love I feel when I’m with my family, my dog, and my incredible ability to reflect on my self.

I know I’m not out of the woods yet, and need to be vigilant, but I’m taking things serious this time. I have begun to build a network of sober friends. We look out for each other and will call each other out. I’ve told my “normy” friends that I can’t drink ever again and to respect that, if you don’t our friendship is over.

I now work out EVERYDAY. If you don’t, then force your self. I was so out of shape at first the only thing I could is walk, and so I walked everywhere until my legs hurt. Every damn day. Now I run, and do dumbbell exercises every morning, and sometimes again at night.

It calms you, you sleep better, you feel good, and it just works. This is the first time I’ve successfully be able to do it.

There is so much positive change in my self I can’t believe it. I’ve also began to repair the relationship with that woman. I know I can’t get her back, but I want to be able to be friends like we were before we dated.

I’m also getting job interviews and taking care of my self.

The motivation to keep healing and improving my self is sky high

However, I did not come out unscathed. All those nights alone suffering with constant, never ending and uncontrollable thoughts about killing my self have left me with a subconscious fear to be alone at home. There have been many times in the past four weeks where I have got home, and then grabbed my dog to go on a long long night walk with me, or I’ll immediately return to the pool hall for more games immediately after leaving.

The exercise helps me be able to fall asleep, but I’m so scared of the time alone with all those thoughts.

But I’m too scared to tell someone personally about what I went through and now my fear of being alone. I don’t want people now to spend the rest of their life worried about me. I know my mom and sister will. I don’t have a therapist right now and don’t think I’ve ever trusted one enough to share this with.

Eventually I need to share this experience and fear with someone. I know it would help but I’m scared.

I’m so sorry for the long post and thank you for reading it if you did. Maybe you can find it inspiring or relatable.

I just needed to put this into words and it’s probably not everything, but some of it. Maybe someone out there will understand. Maybe someone feels the same way and needs to know they’re not alone.

For me, depression feels like:
- Waiting for the day to end, not because I’m excited for anything, but because I just want it to be over
- Wanting to not be alone, while not having the energy to be around people
- Standing in an internal storm of “should haves” while my mind and body completely shut down
- Wanting sleep, but not being able to sleep
- Greasy hair, dirty clothes, and a messy apartment
- A constant loop in my head: “None of this matters anyway”
- Always being there for others, but too afraid to take up space myself
- Not even having the energy to think about food
- Longing to just disappear
- Carrying a permanent sense of guilt
- Feeling inadequate, no matter what I do or how hard I try
- Believing that my existence is a burden to the people around me
- Not being able to see anything good in myself
- Thoughts of death, wishing for the relief it might bring
- Imagining ways I could end my life and how each method might feel
- Overwhelming waves of darkness, where all I can feel is pain, and there’s not even a flicker of hope
- Every little task feels like climbing Mount Everest
- Feeling broken and ashamed for even having these thoughts and feelings
- A constant fear that I’m faking it all and fooling everyone around me
- A deep, persistent doubt in myself, the world, and everyone in it
- Not even being able to handle the thought of getting out of bed

1lxjwo5,Well I think I'm finally ready to admit it.,"A few years ago, I was diagnosed with depression (and I rejected it). I was in total denial. I told myself I was just tired, just going through a phase, that things would get better if I kept pushing through.

Since then, I’ve failed two relationships. I'm still emotionally attached to one of my exes (even though it's been five years). I feel stuck, like I haven’t moved forward at all.

On top of that, I feel extremely lonely. Everyone around me seems so far ahead (either in happy relationships, chasing their dreams, or working their dream jobs) while I’m still here struggling mentally, emotionally, and with anxiety that makes my life feel like a constant battle.

I have no one I can really talk to about this. The few people I call ""friends"" are really just acquaintances. I know they wouldn’t understand (they might even see it as weakness). One of them once said, “You keep having those panic attacks, it’s embarrassing.” That hurt more than I let on.

They’ve all moved on anyway. They're in relationships now and I rarely hear from them. I cut ties with the toxic people in my life because I thought it would bring me peace. I even considered keeping them around just so I wouldn’t be alone... but I chose peace over chaos. And now I keep wondering if I made the right choice.

I have a lot of trauma and have very little positive memories over all. But I used to kinda tank it and move on with my life even if it didn't feel good, just to achieve goals. I was dead inside but  still functional, even despite anxiety and OCD.

Since two weeks ago I've lost ability to care about almost anything. I try to maintain hygiene but usually it doesn't work out. I try to fight off the urge to just sleep. I try to regularly go outside almost everyday even though I don't feel anything postive. I can buy things and do things I wanted but now anything seems uninteresting. I am very tired. I also am very lonely and don't really have anyone to talk and that also really hurts. I spend most of my time dissociating but I try to make effort to stop. When I get control of my body I just watch YT and it sometimes makes me feel a little better but rarely. Usually I feel nothing or just some negative emotions. I try to research things about mental health, maybe it will get better.

I don't know why it got that bad. Even month ago I used to study and go semi-normally outside. Used to have motivation. Now I can't even motivate myself to sit on my computer. I expected to feel happy but instead felt tiredness and negative emotions. I don't know how I had willpower earlier.

Does depression really just starts so abruptly and takes all your motivation to do anything?",1752270745.0,10,3
1lxj726,Becoming malicious,"Since I can remember, throughout my childhood and adolescence, I have had deep desires to die, hatred towards myself and existence, towards adults and a system that failed me, but not anymore. It’s as if something flipped a switch at some point. I no longer wish to die or simply surrender to what nature demands, that someone who lives with depression eventually ends their own life.

And if I am someone destined to die suffering because of depression, weak, incapable, and watching others rise and move forward, then why not use malice and power to achieve what I desire?

Now I have a profound desire to live, to live in solitude and nourish myself with knowledge in order to become someone powerful, i think thats my motivation.

1lxj2qc,Reevaluating relationships,"These past couple months have made me really reevaluate my personal relationships. For most of my life I’ve been masking as the upbeat sarcastic friend who would always listen and be the shoulder to cry on, but in reality I was struggling myself. I opened up to a few people through the years but was very rarely taken seriously. People would listen but then end up turning things around to what is wrong with them and I’d end up being an ear to listen instead of the other way around. I never realized how angry that made me until recently.

I thought about the people who I considered I was close to and I realized we were only close because I was the one who did the reaching out. I was the one who did the listening. I was the one who did the reassuring. I stopped reaching out to my “best friends” and guess what? I haven’t heard from them in months. People I had known for over 20 years, the person who is my son’s godmother, none of them have bothered to check in on me or my kids despite knowing what we are going through right now.

I will no longer expend my energy on those who wouldn’t do the same for me. I have bigger things to worry about than people who were just using me. ",1752269634.0,2,2

Then someone comes into your life, someone you weren’t expecting, someone you weren’t looking for, and someone who changed the fundamental way you viewed life and yourself. Someone who loved you, cherished you, confided in you, and trusted you, and helped you to trust them and yourself. Someone who made you smile every day, who made you happy to be alive. What do you do when they walk away? When they decide they aren’t happy, but pretended they were up until the last moment before they walked out of your life. Someone who took your trust and destroyed it, who cut you out of their life like it meant nothing at all. The only person who ever really understood or cared about you, decided that you weren’t worth fighting for. They didn’t tell you something was wrong, they didn’t tell you they were unhappy, they just found someone better, and cast you aside. What do you do after that? Which path do you take? Is it even worth struggling through the pain and emptiness they create? Or is it all pointless like it was before? Any advice?",1752269350.0,3,3

In a family where no one has my back, i also have to face the rl world where i am at a disadvantage because of my birth sex. All because i was born a woman. A sin, is what my parents always say.

I didnt choose to be born into this world. i didnt choose to be born in this family. i didnt choose to be a woman knowing the disadvantage and hardships of this life. and i certainlty didnt choose to be suicidal.

But over the years, the older i got, the more i came to realize that im all alone. Iv never had anyone stand up for me my entire life and fight for me. I was always casted aside and let down by the ppl around me, most importantly, my own blood.

I was never allowed to enjoy my childhood nor adulthood. i was always reminded of how my body is only a distraction for men. And how my duty as a woman in life is to only be a wife and mother, even tho thats not what i ever wanted.

Im treated completely different from my male siblings. Theyre free and have never been told they cant or can for simply being male. theyre free to live love and enjoy the life they want, but its not the same for me, and it only just keeps getting worse.

i feel like the chains are only getting heavier the older i get and the cell im in is shriniking. I want to kill myself and get this over with. I want my family to feel pity, even if its for a second for all the pain theyve caused me all my life.

1lxgqja,self-pity,"i remember once i was smoking weed with one of my brother's friends and he said something that seemed sort of non sequitur to me.  i asked what he meant and he was like 'you know, like, because you're doomed'.  he was basically asking what it was like being doomed.  it was a dagger through my heart because i hadn't considered myself doomed at the time.  i guess to him that seemed strange since i had just recently gotten out of a psych hospital and was all fucked up, diagnosed with a schizoaffective disorder and sort of homeless (couch surfing, home with parents when i could stand it).  i sort of shrugged it off, told him i could handle it.

as the years have gone by, i come back to this moment all the time.  he was right.  i really am doomed and the thing is there's nothing i can do besides just fucking take it.  that's so hard, though.  it wears me down and i'm not even 40 yet.

i'm really committed to not killing myself, even though i think about it all the time.  it's not a religious thing and it's not for anyone in my life because there's no one in my life who actually needs me.  it would really hurt some people but they don't actually, physically, financially, dependently *need* me.  i stay around because there are moments of intense beauty in my life that i feel only come from being this fucked up.  it makes life different and somehow more personal when you approach everything in agony.

i don't feel like i've had any real chances to save myself, either.  pulling yourself up from your bootstraps, i've done that, but it's not exactly salvation, that's just survival.  the resources for salvation are allocated to someone else now.  i had my time for treatment, i guess i got whatever the system figured *should* have been enough to save a viable unit before realizing that, ya, i'm doomed and the time and energy should go to someone else.  it's a difficult and painful thing to realize nobody thinks you're worth keeping alive or that just watching you die is fine.

I am 20 years old, I live with my father, work in a retail store, drive a car, go to college, all the usual adult stuff as well, live in a stable home.
This year has put my life in a spiral. I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years, she moved on (with her professor??) within 2 months, I have a horrible relationship with my mother, no matter how much I try to explain to my dad, he just tries to fix me and offer me some long winded advice that doesn't apply to what I'm feeling.
I lost 2 friend groups, pushed a lot of people away from doing things I didn't even realize I was doing and even went as far as attempting suicide this year, which ultimately failed. I spent a few days in a psych ward.

I'm stuck scraping for a meaning to life again though. I know I'm venting to strangers online, which is something I always said id never do, but this feels like such a stopping point in my life. I feel like I failed.

I mainly try to stick to myself these days, and yes I go to therapy, and take antidepressants, which seems entirely obsolete at this point. Anyone have any tips for moving on? Maybe advice for being stronger minded about this? I need a change of perspective. ",1752263832.0,1,0

I don't want to be myself. I hate myself more than anything. My body, skinny fat, weak, short, unattractive, my mind, lonely, depressed, undiagnosed with likely autism or what else maybe goes on, addicted to internet since I'm too weak emotionally and now even physically to do anything. My body is rotting away. I can't shower, can't take care of my hair but at least manage to brush my teeth a bit.

Everything I thought my future could be when I was younger feels like it got destroyed before it started. Have a family? How with all that issues with me. Get a job? I only got told I'm useful to be a garbage collector or bake cakes which I can't even do. When my aunt dies one day I am the only one in the house and alone and can't do anything. My bloodline will really end with a shitty person like me.

My skin is horrible, I don't know what to do, my eyes are horrible because I can't wear glasses from sensory issues, my clothes don't fit and are ripped and broken, I have no job, planned on going on a school this year but I feel too weak and anxious, my muscle mass is gone, my bones hurt, I don't have an own room for privacy, I sleep on a couch that is too small, I know so many people have it worse, still all I do is self pity. I had anti depressants for a while but they took them away from me because appereantly 'I don't need them' and tbh they didn't do shit anyway. All placebo.

I don't see anything good anymore exept for my pets and my aunt but I also dissapoint her. I acccomplished nothing, I am nothing and worse is that I found out I might be transgender too. Should I just change gender to get away from the person I hate so much? I can imagine a bit of future if I was the other gender but I don't know, I'm not in the right place. I don't want to go to a doctor or therapist and tell them everything, they know me and my aunt personally, I want to be far away where no one knows me or my past, I am pathetic, I can't do this alone but I am told it is in my responsibility to get help if I don't want to continue like this but the few people around me think I enjoy wasting my life so far and that it is just puberty and 'my personality to be this way' and I need to be left alone. I hate my past self, my present self and my future self too.

All I do is be online and write with fake characters to be less lonely. Mood swings get terrible lately and I feel overall that everything is fake. I just want to be reborn in a life where someone believes in me and where I actually have a purpose on this earth. Sorry for the rant, I'm tired. I wish I could make the best of this life I was given, I wanna be thankful but I don't know where to start. It all probably isn't that bad, right?

1lxdxu4,"""suicide is easy""","How many times have you all heard this? ""Suicide is for weaklings"", ""its an easy way out"" etc etc. Easy way out my fucking ass. People who say that have no clue what theyre talking about. Taking your own life requires a real strong character and resolve as your entire nature resists your desire to die. You're programmed to cling to life no matter what, and even if your mind wants to perish - your body wont let you. You need to go against millions of years of evolution that resulted in you being born, resist your every instinct in order to succeed.  Dying is easy, but killing your very own self is not.

1lxcoh4,I’m feeling depressed and don’t know what to do.,"Hi. First i just wanted to say sorry for my bad english. I hope you can still understand what i’m writing.


I have 4 diagnoses. One of them is schizophrenia. I am really depressed because of my schizophrenia. I tried 2 different medications for depression, but none of them worked, so a doctor told me it was my schizophrenia that made me depressed.
The last 6 months i have been admitted to a mental hospital on/off, because i don’t have any energy and couldn’t see a point in living. I have a bad life. I only have 2 friends who i never see because i don’t have any energy.
I used to talk a lot (so much people would tell me i talked too much), and now i don’t even know what to say to my 2 friends. There was never a silent moment because of me, because i just kept talking and i couldn’t wait for my turn to talk. I’m just really angry, because i suddenly don’t know what to say to my friends.

I also have a problem with food. I eat too much when i’m alone. And some days i starve myself, because i feel guilty when i have eaten so much. (I’m fat, so i’m allowed to starve myself).

I just don’t know what to do with myself. I don’t go to school or have a job, because i don’t have any energy.
I was just wondering, if anyone have been in the same situation i have been in, and what you did to get better?
I just really want to get better, but i don’t know how. I go to therapy (for my schizophrenia and one of the other diagnoses) every week, and it hasn’t helped me. I also get medication, but that doesn’t work on the depressive symptoms (from my schizophrenia).


You don’t have to answer me or write anything, if you don’t want to. I wouldn’t even know what to say to me either, so i get it if you don’t know what to write or don’t want to answer me. And that’s okay :)",1752254273.0,5,2

It feels like I‘m alone in this world, there is not a single person in my life who understands me. Not even my family. No need to talk about my friends, because I don‘t have any.

A couple of years ago, I would have never thought that it could even get this bad. It‘s like someone squeezed every drop of happiness out of me.

On top of that, there rarely goes a day by where I don‘t drink or smoke weed. It‘s the only place where I don‘t feel like shit.

1lxblhf,I’m [23m]a bedrotting germaphobe with a slight OCD which is kind of ironic and funny - well thats the only funny thing about my life for now.,"Have been bedrotting jobless and educationless in my room for 3 years.

Yes I have plates of food in my room. But I use two chairs. One to hold the old plates and one to eat from. And I stack it cleanly on the other chair until I run out of plates. I can gauge exactly how much I’ll eat so I barely have leftovers which is why how I can tolerate dirty dishes in my room.

My trash is tidily strewn across the floor far from my bed on the floor. Can be messy but I use bags to compartmentalize. I can accept trash being in the room but it has to be in a bag. It cant be on the floor. Happens until room is full of bags.

The worst part - and when I have panic attacks is when I see actual germs like the petridish stuff growing from somewhere.

Thats when I start kinda cleaning. Well only that part. I developed a special skill which is called forgetting intentionally.

I do change my clothes everyday, and take a bath everyday. Thats how I can keep the same bed sheets for 6 months. I sleep on the floor and my back hurts. When I eat I sit on my bed and eat on a chair. Thats how “clean” I am since I am always careful about getting food on my bed.

Also I do spill stuff on my table / chairs. But the life hack is I let the ants clean them for me. They never bothered me. And to be honest I like them. If I spill rice or something on the floor it will be gone tommorow because of the ants…

I think I made this post because of the irony of it all. Everyday I feel like I am a very clean person living in a room of disgust. I can’t even sit in the bed without making sure my feet are clean and my clothes are fresh. If I touch food I wash my hands with soap thoroughly before touching any part of the bed. And sometimes I wash it three more times even when I’ve already thoroughly washed it.

This life is worthless.

Its kind of made me agoraphobic. Not gonna lie. Just because when I talk to people they ask me about my life, and I can’t answer “just waiting for it to end”

I wish I can exchange my life for someone who wants to live.

To be honest I feel I’m born into a world that is full of lies. And I feel like I see through that lie and thats why I have no motivation to live it.

I do want to fall in love atleast. But It has never been reciprocated… oh well.

I know it's wrong to feel jealous, but every time I see my friends succeeding buying their own homes, driving brand-new cars I can’t help but feel envious. I want that too. But life feels so unfair. I have to support my family, and even though I want to start my own business, I simply don’t have the money to do it. I can’t save anything because my salary isn’t very high, and most of it goes to bills and daily expenses.

Sometimes, I feel like giving up. I think about growing old without any savings, without insurance, and ending up on the streets, homeless. My parents don’t own any land that I could inherit, so I feel like I'm doomed.

 Im a f(17) Like the title says i hate my life most of the time! Sometimes i dont feel as depressed because i disconnect from the reality , but as soon as i remember the reality of my life the depression hits me again.
Sometimes i feel so hopeful about life it lasts for a week or so but then the depression comes back and stays for months
I really tried my best to be happier to do better to appreciate life to find peace and beauty in life but it only lasts for a week and then the feelings comes back the feeling of hatred towards life and almost everyone i know!
And i have an identity crisis or i feel like i don’t belong sometimes i feel like my parents aren’t my real parents and they had mistaken me with their real kid in the hospital idk things like that because i feel so lost in this environment like i don’t belong at all i tried to love it to appreciate it to love my parents and everything but i cant
They are not good people especially my dad !
I have a horrible older brother like so horrible , I dont even consider him my brother anymore.
But thankfully i have my younger sister the only person i really appreciate .
Im so mad at life im so mad at everyone, i always ask god why this family why this culture:( i just feel so foreign in it , its crazy i suffer everyday i wake up in the morning feeling pain , everytime my parents talk to me i feel like killing myself , i wish it can end cuz i can’t handle it anymore .
Even in my comfortable days i feel like this happiness that im feeling at that moment is not real is just a lie to forget about my sadness
My life is not completely horrible, i can make it better but i just feel like i don’t get the opportunity to do so!
I have big dreams but my environment makes it impossible to dream big because they are so negative and miserable themselves
Idk how im gonna live with this anymore nothing feels real i can’t believe this is my real life it feels like a horrible dream.

Coz the fact im here is what many people here are. You're tired. For me, things aren't going well for me.  As life get's harder, I'm collapsing more and more. Going through stress, going through pressure. Trying to keep yourself together when you feel things are breaking too much. It reaches a point you wonder what's the point of seeing the next day when you can take a good guess how it goes. I don't want this. I hatee that every minute of the day, even now, I'm worrying or stressing about the issues I have both in me and out there.
I hate being alone. With no friends because you're weird and you don't fit in or you're severely lacking in a personality or common interest or whatever. Or a family that can't understand your pain. They say they care and they want the best for you, but when you try to speak out, it's just a passing phase and 2 days of therapy is enough to fix you. I Hate that I'm a failure, that I have nothing to show for myself apart from how of a disappointment I am and will always will be. I have many things to hate, which just all sums it up to hating myself. I can't even imagine a better future, coz I don't know what kind of a future is there for me. I have no dreams, no goals or aspirations. And the things I love and enjoy slowly dull away.
Anyways, this was more of trying to let it all out. I have no clue how Im supposed to help myself, or what to hold on to. I just have to blindly look around in the darkness and hope for things to be better. Whatever that means. ",1752244959.0,1,0
1lx8nsr,Convincing everyone but myself..,"I (29F) feel like a little porcelain doll.. beautiful to look at but hollow inside. My family immigrated to the US back in 2002 from a very poor country, I was about 7 at the time. Prior to the move I went through a lot for a 7 year old, from watching my father constantly cheat on my mother and tell me to lie about it, to being sa by a family member..
I never spoke of either subject until I was about 17, I just smiled and acted like nothing happened but was self harming in secrecy.. Flash forward to now, I have an amazing fiancé, I’m in the way physical shape I have ever been, my career is great and we have a beautiful home but I still feel hollow. I feel like an imposter and have no one to tell this to because no one in my life has ever known how broken I am inside. If I look even remotely sad in-front of anyone I quickly gather myself, smile &amp; speak in my customer service voice. I am petrified of someone finding out how bad my mental health really is and constantly feel like I am physically suffocating, like a heavy weight is right on my chest, my brain will constantly tell me I should just end it. So I sneak off and hide somewhere with a knife, a blade or any sharp object I can find, hold it against my skin and push as hard as I can. I will cut myself in areas that are not visible to others and often they won’t even be real cuts more like scratches.(think of it as pressure cooker finally being opened)
I do not know how I can keep this up, my wedding is coming up and that has brought up so many little stressors that are triggering these thoughts/feelings and now I am finding myself pinching or digging my nails into my skin during any situation I feel uncomfortable/stressed in and cannot escape but if you see my face I am smiling nodding and engaging. This is supposed to be in the happiest time of my life but I am constantly disassociating and hurting myself, my fiancé caught me digging my nails into my arm and during a tour of our venue and I just minimized it and blew him off then put on a big smile and continued with the tour. Is this how my life will always be? Other than being depressed and anxious is this something else? Please any advice will help.

1lx6pim,I feel so uncomfortable being alive,"Massive TW: self-harm, suicide, homicidal intent

I haven't got any idea why but I cant just sit still for a moment and not thibk about ending it. As of today, all I've done was scroll on YouTube and think of my ex. I cant find a comfortable position and it feels like I'm out of place in this world. Im constantly being alone when I don't wanna be alone and always forced to be around people when I physically cant be myself. I haven't been myself for a few weeks now. I stopped being able to hold back my anger and sadness like I usually do. I do have therapy every week, but its not enough. As I'm writing this, I'm fantasising about ending my life or hurting other people in really gruesome ways. I know one day it'll happen, but I'm not built for prison (im too polite 😢). I was caught having a meltdown last night and hurting myself in the kitchen. My goal was to see the light at the end of the tunnel as fast as possible but in my state of insanity and rage, I got carried away with it. A lot more happened that night. But during the day that led up to the events, I got so angry at my whole friend group and i cut most of them off and told them i dont consider them as friends, especially when theyre still friends with my ex, who i think is a big reason why my mental health dramatically dropped over the 2 years we've been together. I dont like being who i am, but now i also know that the girl who thought she'd be an amazing psychologist doesnt know shit about how peoples minds work when theyre barely in control a lot of the time. I admit, I've done and said some awful things too, mainly due to how angry I get over the smallest mistakes. I have been patient though. But I realised I cant keep trying to change someone who doesn't want to for the sake of someone she said she loved. The friend group that I put together forgot about me and just let her in when I made it clear that if she was gonna be with us, I'd not be able to be myself. So until they realise how much of a prick she was, they're not my friends. I tried to do the best I could while pushing away my feelings so I dont end up hurting hers or accidentally triggering the exact same for her. By this I mean that I noticed how usually when I show how I feel sad, guilty, angry, or let my depression show, she always replicates it and it results in me trying to validate how she felt and comfort her while she stays as stubborn as a mule. Eventually I lost the ability to care and validate any more rubbish from her. She didnt think to ask what was going on with me. Every time either of us made a mistake, we'd always argue. I feel really uncomfortable knowing that my own friends are gonna accept her for her fake and boring personality, knowing how she's made me feel. I also dont want to keep being threatened with mental hospitals by my own family every time I crack (which rarely happens). So I just let it build up more and more and these meltdowns are happening more frequently. She said she'd always stay with me even through all of my bad times, but that was only because I had a meltdown in front of her and she was trying to comfort me. I knew she'd leave me alone when my mental health was hanging on by a thread because she didnt want to do anything to try to be a decent person. And that is why im so uncomfortable with being alive. Knowing that eventually, she'll just meet someone else and the cycle will happen again. Either that or we end up back together again. She was a toxic person and really bad for me. Despite knowing that, I stayed with her because she needed me. I hope the next time she sees me is when I'm being buried. Then maybe she'll see how her unlovable character and boring personality and her lack of care or affection ended up with me dying multiple times. Sorry for all the yapping.

1lx6f4o,Mentally ill jobless shunned loser rambling,"I'm 25M, just turned 25 about one week ago. I want to vent a little so sorry if I sound insufferable because I actually am frustrated and I'm kinda done pretending.

This isn't really news for me, I've thought about killing myself quite a few times, enough times to be put on benzos and SSRIs. I'm actually quite ""normal"" now, I've been off meds for almost a year. I went through a very chaotic time for the last decade, and it seemed like it was building up until it hit its boiling point last year.

I managed to graduate 6 months ago, I got my drivers license. So it's been relatively calm, but that's because there's literally nothing going on in my professional life. I've been job hunting with little to show for it, aside from the occasional interview here and there, and I've successfully bombed every single one. Thing is, I've been disillusioned for a while now and it's becoming harder to keep up with this charade, I'm not even buying my own act anymore.

I honestly thought I’d be out of the country by now. That was the main reason I chose Computer Science as my major. I figured it would at least guarantee a job since it's in high demand. But with the AI boom and the ongoing job crisis, it’s getting harder just to network, let alone secure an interview. I’m constantly getting left on read. Oh, and all those damn Indians filling up every position within 5 minutes of the job offer being posted.

But I'm not here to cry about that because I've been blackpilled that none of this really matters to me: I picked a major that I hated, wasted 10 years of my life, went through a lot mentally and physically. The only thing that kept me going was the faint glimmer of hope that, by the end of this, I’d land a steady job with a steady income, get my life back on track, and slowly start rebuilding from there. This might sound irrational, but I'm starting to believe that letting go of that delusion would help me immensely. If we face the facts: I'm back to being stuck with my parents, the very thing I was desperately trying to escape in order to gain independence. Realistically, I'm just never going to make it.

Being stuck with my parents for the past 6 months has been so psychologically destructive and demoralizing to me. I don’t want to get into details, but honestly, it would make perfect sense if you spent a week with them and felt like you just wanted to fuck off from the country and never come back. Actually, I don't blame my parents because it's not just them, it's the actual mentality at large. Everyone and everything is so miserable, hive-minded and unhelpful. I was never enough no matter how much I excelled academically, even to the detriment of my personal life and emotional development. I buried myself in books for so long that I forgot to live, to let loose, to go out. I feel like I’ve let my youth slip through my fingers, and I hate myself for it every single day. On top of that, I now have to cope with the social awkwardness, isolation, and avoidant tendencies that came along with it. I feel perpetually stuck at 16.

I also just don’t have good judgment. Not only did I pick a major that sucks, but I could’ve chosen something else, like literature or philosophy, which are subjects that are kind of shunned here. (Again, I live in a very regressive, peasant-minded society where only doctors and engineers matter) Instead, I ended up with a ton of damage and emotional baggage, which I could probably draw from if I were creative enough. Gay suffering always seems more appealing and meaningful when it's on paper.

I would love to start over but I'm already halfway though my 20s. I have no meaningful experience, no friends, no romantic relationships, no job, no actual goals. Idk it feels like I'm just rambling with no direction but I'm just really never gonna live a fruitful life. I can't build a family or have kids. I've always wanted to go out clubbing and get wasted and get laid which I think would do me good but I just can't do any of that in this environment. It feels like I'm constantly suffocating, with the walls closing in at the slightest hint of suspicion, and I'm always paranoid about being judged by others, which shouldn't even matter at this point because I'm already kinda ostracized but whatever. I think I've been conditioned to feel that way since childhood.

All of that to say. I'm feeling very serotonin deprived. And I live in a perpetual state of emptiness and hopelessness, and I can't cope much longer. I always had in mind something I like to call Project 2027. If I don't get my shit together by then, I just might as well be dead.",1752239181.0,5,1

I have a full time WFH job, I have a husband who loves me, a daughter who is overall a good kid. But I am a monster and I feel like I just need to be put down.

I am a terrible mother and I can't be bothered to do better. I yell at her for stupid things all the time. I try to stop but then I'm at it again. I'm too stupid to learn. My daughter wouldn't care if I were here or not. She loves her daddy, as she should. I had her from an abusive relationship which involved SA - resulting in her. It's not her fault. I'm just fucking awful.

My husband is desperately trying to save my life and I'm so selfish I can't even receive it correctly. He tells me how much he loves me, how much it would destroy his life if I weren't here, and yet here I am still wanting to just fucking die. He deserves a wife that can be strong for him, that isn't sick, that he doesn't have to keep saving. He'll get tired of me and realize it, I'm sure. I love him so much but I feel like the best thing I can do for him is die. I can't inflict suffering on him if I'm dead.

From the outside and to the people around me I was pretty much emotionless. I couldn't understand my emotions so instead I just ignored them. Because I did this, it made them even worse and stronger. I also thought that having negative emotions such as sadness was weak and was not how men or boys are supposed to be or act. I thought crying from sadness was weak and not masculine. I couldn't address my feelings of sadness at that time because I didnt understand them. So instead, I channeled that sad energy into being frustrated and angry and I would take this energy out on myself by calling myself negative things and telling myself things like I hate myself. By doing this and saying things like this to myself, I convinced myself that these negative thoughts were all true even though they weren't. There was truth within them, but the negativity that I carried attached to them had manifested itself into my reality. I had good reasons to feel the ways I felt, but the reality of the situation and what I know now from looking back on it, was that my feelings were most likely not how other people would view or percieve the sitution.

1lx3e0c,Struggling,"Last year I was struggling a lot with my mental health, I took Fluoxetine/Prozac for about 6 years and was relatively stable on it for the most part, but during a low spell last year I spoke to a GP who suggested that other SSRIs might help.

They wound down the Fluoxetine and I started on Sertaline, which didn’t help and caused me to not sleep, and then to Citalopram, and finally to a higher dosage of Citalopram, which still didn’t really feel like it was helping much, but I suppose must have been.

During the period where I was transitioning between SSRIs, I lost my grandmother who I was very close to. I haven’t really ever gotten back to the level of emotional stability I had before that.

Things have steadily worsened, my mental health kept me out of my job, which has led to me nearly losing it, and being in a very precarious position financially. This has also caused a lot of stress between myself and my partner, as I know she struggles to understand my condition. As an effort to improve things, I’ve spoken to my GP and asked to move back to Prozac/Fluoxetine, which I started doing last week.

Unfortunately going from Citalopram to a lower dose of Prozac than I used to take has pushed my mental health basically off a cliff. I’ve had rampant panic attacks, can barely leave the house and struggle to hold conversations.

My doctors have said it could be up to 6 weeks before the Prozac starts helping, and we’ll probably need to increase the dosage, as 20mg was never enough for me before, but I really don’t know how the hell I’m supposed to get through another week of feeling like this.

I’m stressed about work, but I can’t take any time off or I’ll lose my job, I’m arguing constantly with my partner, she tells me that my depression makes me selfish, lazy and a bad boyfriend and that she doesn’t want the rest of her life to look like this. I’m in really poor health physically at the moment due to a combination of my depression and a hernia that’s prevented me from exercising much lately, I feel so incredibly weak and drained constantly and I can’t even go for a run to make myself feel any better.

I just don’t feel like I have the energy to even keep going, let alone to do difficult things like work at being a better partner when I feel like this

I just don’t know how things improve from here, and I’m really scared they don’t",1752229709.0,1,0
1lx38o7,"Comparison, I hate being jealous, I feel annoying and unlikable. I don’t want to lose him or anyone.","Context:
Been struggling with depression and mild thoughts of offing myself since the 8th grade, I am now going into my sophomore year of college. It’s always been triggered by my life at home and my lack of social skills and that I’m mildly neurodivergent. I’ve never made genuine friends without having to mask. Putting on makeup and trendy clothes to feel liked in an incredibly toxic friend group. The friend group I had in high school was very different to me, I would be purposefully excluded and made fun of on many occasions and honestly it made me push harder on my academics since that’s all I had. I met my now boyfriend in the 11th grade, we quickly became friends as I felt I could finally be myself around him. I felt like I didn’t have to mask, he understood me and I was infatuated with him. My strict parents were quick to shut this down, as they would also quickly shut down hanging out with friends outside of school. Ultimately leading me to spiral into a deeper hole of insecurity and social anxiety for the majority of adolescence and even in my young adult years. I stay in my room and maladaptive daydream so much. My brian replays moments at which I felt I had friends. I often rewrite moments as a way to cope with having my teenage years being alright and then sadly transitioning into my lonely college years.

Okay now the meat of the story:
I thought I would never date as I’ve been used to focusing on myself and my grades. As mentioned before I started dating my boyfriend in highschool. I was so happy. I finally had a way to escape from my toxic friend group and spend my time with someone who actually liked me. He liked me for who I was, my real interests. Despite what others said about me to make fun of me, he defended me, it made me feel seen and loved. He was and is quite popular, even in college, always able to easily make friends, meet new people, and spark conversations like a piece of cake. We will be together for two years in october. I would receive so much attention from him, it was something new, and i loved it. It was just me and him . However, since we’ve grown farther apart due to graduating and school, I’m been lacking that attention and love that brought me out of a dark and lonely place. I feel that I am so reliant on how often he texts or calls me because he is quite literally my only friend. He has so many great things going for him, lots of friends and opportunities. I feel jealous and I can’t hide my emotions anymore. I need to calm down, I don’t want to lose him. ",1752229150.0,3,0

1lx20nz,My Pent Up Feelings,"This will probably be my first and only post, not that I want to kill myself, but because I just want to get out these thoughts.



From the very young age of five, I remember telling my mother, ""I want to kill myself."" My teachers would often bring to her attention the kind of drawings I had done in my sketchpad, that of someone jumping off a building and splattering on the floor. I probably got this idea from a show my grandma used to watch, I can't remember the name, but it had an episode where someone committed suicide via jumping off a building, some cop show or whatever.

I didn't have a father, not that he died, but he left. I grew up watching those around me with their parents, wishing I could have been a normal child, all while hearing countless phone calls and shouts whilst in my room, begging for a deadbeat to do his job. Nobody was stable in this house. I made it my duty; even if all is not right, I will be a ray of light. Even if everyone in the household is down, if I can keep my mood up, the atmosphere won't be at a total loss. If I don't break down, everyone will be alright.

""If I can save at least one person from their depression, to make them want to live and not want to kill themselves anymore, I'd be fine with dying.""

That thought, those words, were the beginning of my undoing.

Throughout the years, I've played adult. I was a therapist for those twice my age, took on problems I never should have, encountered many who would wave around their suicidal tendencies like a badge of honor, worrying me as I tried to ""protect"" them. The more I took on their problems, the deeper into madness I fell. The more scenarios I encountered, depressing, romantic, nauseating, gut wrenching, it all piled up.

As that child who had a wish, that child who wanted to be a ray of light, my problems were mine alone to handle. I would carry everyone's on my shoulder, but my own? It didn't matter, really. That's what I thought at the time. Slowly but surely, the loneliness crept in, nobody there to comfort me in my darkest hours as I had done for many, many, many many many many many many others. Yet, I held on with strong mental, I grew self sufficient, yet, the loneliness never faded.

Before I knew it, it all became too much. Many years passed, I've grown plenty. Though I forsook my childhood in order to help others, I don't mind. With my many experiences, I've became great at helping others and being there for those around me, a steady shoulder to rely on. Those suicidal thoughts of the past? They do sometimes poke their head in, but I've overcome them for the most part.

However, one problem remained.

""I would carry everyone's on my shoulder, but my own? It didn't matter, really.""

To this day, I still help people, way less now since I've learnt that others' issues aren't my problem, in actuality. Yet, a part of me held that self sacrificial oath within still. As always, I did, and still do, take joy in helping others. The problem? I've encountered few I know would love to shoulder the burden with me, for example, my best friend, my ex for sure would have, and a girl I recently lost thanks to my indecisiveness. The last one, only after we talked no longer, did I realise, that she probably really wanted to be there for me, but I couldn't let her do that. I can imagine that ate away at her, hurting her seeing me suffering without knowing why or even where to begin. Thankfully, she's happier with someone else now. Even if I can't enjoy any of my interests anymore, which I had all shared with her, at least she found someone that was able to treat her the way she deserved.

Getting back on track, if it wasn't obvious, the problem is that I am now incapable of talking about my feelings. This post may sound like my feelings, but in a way, they're different. They're my thoughts. After all these years of build up, playing adult, fighting it all on my own, I find myself constantly on the edge of insanity, only my morals and values keeping me standing.

It's not that I don't want to talk about my feelings, I really do, but I feel as though they've become a massive mountain. I didn't shake off the dirt which had coalesced on my back all this time, and now, it feels as though it's become far too much to share with anyone. There are people in my life now that would gladly listen, but I can never bring myself to share it. The hurt, the raging emotions inside of me, the unsaid feelings, it's not myself that I would fear, it's how they feel.

Even scratching the surface, I've left many speechless at times. How could I ever share it? It would only make the people I love, the people around me, sad, perhaps desperate. Have you ever talked to someone depressed, and you get that nauseating feeling? ""Oh no, I can't handle this. This is too much. I want to run away, I can't help this person,"" like a warning signal beckoning you to vanish before you become a part of something too great for yourself? Yeah, that's the feeling I'm almost certain I give those that I do tell some. They want to be there for me, but what I feel is far too overwhelming for them.

Congratulations to the one and only, I can stand alone, I can carry the world. I might as well call myself Atlas. However, no one can stand alongside me any longer. Everyone has their own life. While they do have reservations for friends, this crushing weight is one they could never bear along with their own. I got my wish, I can help others now, if only I had included myself in the people I wanted to be helped.

Hey, it's not like I haven't tried? I've tried getting into it, but even just starting, I can see them feeling overwhelmed already, I just can't. I can't let them feel sad because of me. I have to be the reliable adult I am now, still posing as a ray of light, how could I possibly let those around me feel that way? I can see that feeling, that they want to run, yet they stay there. I am blessed with great friends, indeed. But it's because they're so great, that they choose not to run, but to stay here for me, that I cannot. I have to be strong. I have to be able to overcome it on my own, so no one has to worry about me any longer.


Will you listen to me? I'm lonely. I want help. I want to be saved. Please save me. I feel like these feelings will consume me night after night. I want love, even if it ruins me. I want to share my burden. I want someone who can listen to me, understand my internal struggles that I still have yet to voice, listen to my past, the present me, and help me reach a better future. Please, I beg you. Isn't there at least one person out there who can help? Do I have to spend the rest of my life like this? Unable to share with anyone? Must this loneliness and pain plague me until death. I know, it's irresponsible of me to ever expect for someone to handle all my problems with me, it'd be more mature to suck it up and be an adult. Everyone has their own issues, who has time for all of mine, right?

Please. Please. Please. I've helped so, so many. Please help me too. Please stay. Please don't look at me with that face of pity. Please don't look at me like you want to run away. Please tell me you'll stay. Please, don't let me feel alone anymore. Please, even if I become someone who isn't me anymore, accept me. Please, let me lay bare everything. Please, I want someone to hear it all. Please, let me erode this mountain, my back is tired. I'm tired. Please, just let me be happy.

This all seems like a joke, right? My writing like this, I mean. It probably makes you skeptical if this is all real, maybe some elaborate prank or a troll post. I actually find joy in writing stories, not that I have much time for it. This was the only way I could see myself getting this post across. After all, when I look in the mirror, all I can see is a jester, serving everyone around him. Can't I be at least a little dramatic? Otherwise, wouldn't all this be too overwhelming?

If anyone dared to read all of this, thank you. I won't be responding to any comments, if you have any. This ie the first, and the last post I will make. I will go to sleep, and once again, wake up to another day. I will carry not only my tiny world of worries, but those of the people around me as well. This is the only purpose I have, and the only worth I see in myself.",1752224379.0,2,0
1lx1zhq,Buried A Friend in April. Found Out Another Just Died,"I don't deal with death all that well. A friend I hadn't seen in almost 4 years died from an overdose. Someone that I considered my second mom just died of heart disease (undiagnosed, untreated). I finally got myself to stop thinking about my friend and then I found out a woman that helped my own mom raise me died almost two days after we finally got a chance to talk. This family, this woman gave me something so beautiful over the years. Friends that felt like family, love so raw and genuine and pure--but real. I'd never had that before meeting them, and I was a kid. My best friend, her daughter. I wish I could be there for them, to take away whatever pain and grief they're feeling.

1lx0zie,Never realized it could be this bad.,"Hi guys, I'm using an alt account because
I'd rather my friends and family not find out about my struggles right now (I just don't see it being helpful).

     My high school junior year is approaching and I just really need an outlet to speak everything on my mind right now. Starting a couple months back, the academic pressures from my school really started to take a heavy toll on my mental health and I've just been in a downward spiral since then. It started off as sort of like this feeling of inadequacy and dissatisfaction but as the months went on it's just gotten so much worse. I feel like a lot of little things over time have just compounded into my current mental state.
     I don't think there's been a week since then where I haven't thought about suicide. It gets particularly worse at night. During the day I usually try to keep myself busy to avoid these thoughts but when I'm just alone or trying to fall asleep for instance I just can't turn it off. I tell myself that I'm worthless, that I have nothing to offer in this world, there's no point in continuing to try because l'm just so inadequate at everything, etc. (you probably understand).
     But getting back to what I was talking about earlier, during the school year I thought that once summer came and I could relax it would get better but it just didn’t. It’s actually gotten worse!! Some days I can’t get up and it’s so saddening because parts of me still has goals that I want to achieve and I just feel like I’m rotting away and wasting everything. Sometimes I feel like I’m a piece of garbage for feeling this way because truthfully I have it better than probably 90% of the world population (as a middle class American). I feel like I’m not being grateful but something is genuinely so wrong with me and I don’t know what it is.
     I guess I also never realized what people go through. Like sometimes we get sad or something but this is genuinely such an uphill struggle everyday. To not self harm, to not give up, to try and not lose hope; it feels like I’ll live with this forever. I just want to be myself again. I used to be relatively confident and happy with myself, but over the past few months, I’ve tried to improve in my skills, physical appearance, studies, etc., and all that it’s done is plummet my self esteem.
      Can we also acknowledge that it is difficult to get out of this, especially for teenagers. As a child of immigrants, I think it’s hard for me to tell them about my current state of mind since they’re more culturally conservative and don’t really consider mental health as having tangible impacts throughout life. So I can’t get access to a therapist, a psych, meds; all I have is Reddit! It’s kind of funny to think about but not so funny when you consider there are way more teens out there that are suffering from worse things but are equally as trapped.
      And I rarely tell my friends about it because sometimes people just don’t care and honestly make things worse. Which I don’t blame them for, they’re not therapists. They’re people who are probably going through similar things and are equally as lost.
      Idk, I just needed to write all this down I think that’s important. Maybe some of you feel similarly. ",1752220149.0,2,1

1lx03wj,Why do people become distant or jealous even when I'm always kind and helpful?,"I’m a 26-year-old man, and I’ve always found it easy to make friends quickly. I genuinely enjoy being nice to people, helping them, and trusting them fully. But over time, I’ve noticed a pattern that’s starting to bother me, people often grow distant, act strangely, or even seem jealous for reasons I can’t fully understand.

One recent example: I joined a gym, and within a few days, I struck up a friendly connection with the gym owner. Everything was going well, but after he tried to sell me some supplements and I politely refused, saying I prefer to train naturally, his attitude toward me completely changed. He hasn’t been nice since, and I’m pretty sure it’s because I didn’t buy the products.

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Back in college, I had a lot of friends on the surface, but many would talk behind my back and act cold or jealous for no clear reason. I’ve always been open, never hidden anything, and even gone out of my way to support people, sometimes more than their own close friends did.

I don’t understand why this keeps happening. Am I doing something wrong? How do I deal with this kind of behavior without letting it affect my peace of mind?",1752216706.0,2,2

Like today, my mom came home from a walk and tried to give me a short tutorial on how to crochet because I kept asking her to but when I tried, I couldn’t do anything right, my glasses were glaring in my eyes, my sister was stressing me out just being in the room (not her fault, I don’t know why that happened) and I was trying so bad not to cry out of frustration because I know I was being pathetic while my mom was trying to cheer me up but nothing was helping and I ruined what could’ve been a fun bonding moment or a new hobby.

I spend all day just laying down and I can’t be bothered to do anything with my life. I couldn’t get a job, I hate the idea of making my mom pay for me to get my driving permit (which I can start soon) and I‘m just so tired of living with nothing to show for it. I’m starting a new school in august and even that doesn’t make me excited which i hate because I feel like I’m just a negative person all the time and I drag everyone around me down. My mom does everything for me and all I can do it sit there and mope. She never makes me feel bad but I know I stress her out. I‘m constantly upset with my life and I don’t know what to do. I just want to kill myself but I can’t bring myself to do it. I have no friends, my family doesn’t deserve me, and I just take up space on this earth.

I genuinely never had anyone I felt comfortable sharing my feelings with, nor can I see myself being near that any day soon. Right now I’m just lying down, in bed just watching YouTube. I do this nearly every night, hoping to hear the sound of laughter and fun times with friends via gamer content creators as I just want that. I yearn for a friend or really just anyone that makes me forget that life is a lonely sentence of solitude that’s only briefly interrupted by the faint joy of others. Lately I grow even more empty, I’ve even noticed that I fake laugh, I used to never do that. I feel disgusted by that, the concept of lying to those that do care for me, when all I want to do is break down crying to beg them for any help, as if I’d even know what to ask for. Some nights I stare at my straight razor and just look at it. I wouldn’t ever cut myself, nor kill myself. But I find it rather alarming that I’d rather spend time staying up, far past a normal time to sleep so I can just pretend to be happy to fill a void that can’t be filled.

I messaged to ask him for at least closure and nothing. I was and still am clearly hurting. Come to find out. He made entirely new socials and has been active since I sent my original apology.

I’m the oldest yet my younger siblings have friends and relationships but I don’t have anyone. Every time I try to make friends something goes wrong and I still remain alone so a romantic relationship is out of the question. People say there are 8 billion people in the world it’s unlikely for you to be alone but what people fail to understand is that that logic does not always work there are many people who have lived lonely and weren’t able to find connections with people. I am one of those people I’ve experienced chronic loneliness since I was 8.

Not just physically, but spiritually, emotionally, in every cell of my body. I feel like I’ve been carrying this heavy weight for years and no one even notices I’m struggling to breathe under it.

I’ve spent so long hating the way I look. I feel disgusting in my own skin. I avoid mirrors. I avoid eye contact. I avoid people. I don’t feel human most days. I feel like something people look past, or look at with discomfort. I try to change. I’ve changed my clothes, the way I act, the way I speak. I try to shrink myself to be more likable. I try to stand out to get noticed. Nothing ever works. People don’t choose me. They never have. Especially in dating. Especially men. It’s like I’m invisible until I’m not, and when I’m not, it’s usually just so they can move away.

The worst part is that I’ve internalized it. I’ve started believing what I think others see. That I’m ugly. Worthless. Unlovable. That I’m the one who deserves to be left out. That if people knew how broken I really am, they’d walk even faster.

I don’t know what I like. I don’t know who I am. I feel like I’ve spent so much time trying to become someone who could be loved that I don’t even know what’s real anymore. Everything feels fake. Every smile, every small talk moment, every performance of “I’m okay.” I’m not okay.

I wish someone would hold me. I wish someone would look at me and think I’m beautiful. I wish I didn’t feel so much shame all the time. I wish I didn’t feel so alone in every room I walk into. I wish I felt like my existence made a difference to anyone.

I think about disappearing all the time. Not even dramatically. Just fading. Just not waking up. I think about how little would change if I was gone. How quickly I’d be forgotten. I tell myself that’s the depression talking, but some days it sounds so rational, so matter-of-fact, that it’s hard to argue with.

I’m not writing this for attention. I don’t even know if anyone will respond. I just need to put it somewhere outside of my head. I’m tired of pretending I’m okay. I’m tired of hating myself. I’m tired of waiting for my life to feel like it matters.

If you’ve ever felt this way too, I see you. And if you’ve made it through to the other side, I’d like to know how. Because right now it’s just me, and this ache that doesn’t go away, and the hope that maybe putting this here is one small act of not giving up.

1lwxeb2,I hate myself.,"For context, I’ve struggled with body dismorphia and have been a social reject throughout all of middle school and high school and even some parts of elementary school. I played ice hockey so I would constantly get made fun of in the locker room whenever I took my shirt off. Every. Single. Time. I took my shirt off someone said something or someone would poke me or someone would take jabs at me.

Eventually the summer leading into my junior year of high school I finally had enough of the crap and decided to hit the gym. I began working out (I hated it at first, but now it’s my favorite thing in the world). I made progress and now in the present day (I just graduated from high school this year) I constantly get compliments about how much I’ve changed and how I’ve become a so called, “more confident person”. In reality though I still see that fat stubby kid who would constantly get touched or made fun of in the locker room. I got a compliment earlier today about how lean I’ve gotten, but I feel like they’re lying. My parents say the same thing that they’ve noticed changes, but I don’t believe them. I don’t believe anyone. I still feel fat. I still feel like shit.

That’s just the physical part. I constantly feel alone or depressed or just empty. Things that used to bring me joy such as video games hardly bring me the same happiness that I used to feel. I want to find love but I don’t feel like I deserve it. I constantly belittle or underestimate my own abilities. My parents constantly tell me I shouldn’t do that, but I can’t help it. My brain takes any chance it can get to put me down or make me numb. Most days I don’t feel much emotion any more. Happiness, sadness, anger, lust. All of it. They’ve grown less and less as the days go by. The only times I ever experience any kinds of emotions are late at night (like right now).

To add insult to injury, My achievements also bring me no joy. I’m a musician as well by the way. I’ve made my states all state band and orchestra the last two years but both times I didn’t feel happy about it in the slightest. People told me that it’s a great accomplishment and that I should be proud, but I never am. I got into a really good college that I told everyone I would go to back in 6th grade. I proclaimed to everyone (like an idiot) “I’m going to _”. Everyone constantly told me “you’re not smart enough to go there” “you’ve got no chance”. But I did. I defied the odds and got into almost every single school I applied to and yet, I didn’t feel happy or proud of myself.

I’ve become really fond of super expensive sports cars and super cars these last few years as well. I’ve made it my life goal to achieve that someday. Maybe material goods will fill this hole I have within me. I just feel so empty. I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s like I’m living on autopilot. When I drive my mind is blank. When I eat my mind is blank. I’ve thought about ending it before, but I realized that I don’t want to die, I don’t want to hurt those close to me, and I’ve got goals that I need to achieve some day. So I scratched that off the list.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. From an outside point of view it would seem like I’ve got it made. Good academics, good extracurricular, good health, good opportunities. That’s what people keep telling me anyway. But I don’t feel good at all. I’m really bad at explaining this so ask questions if you need me to clarify. I don’t feel happy very often, I don’t feel proud of myself accomplishments, I constantly yearn for a loving relationship but feel that I don’t deserve one. Please, someone try to explain what’s wrong with me because I can’t think straight. My anxiety and ADHD do not help whatsoever in thinking these kinds of things through so any help would be much appreciated. I hate myself. ",1752207076.0,3,7

I am 20 years old and I first felt suicidal when I was 13. I never planned for my future because I never thought i'd make it to age 20 but here I am anyways...

Now I'm 20 and in a rut. I was planning on going back to college to study phlebotomy but my mind is screaming at me 24/7 to the point where leaving my bedroom is pretty hard sometimes. I physically feel like a zombie even though I'm perfectly healthy.

I'm not being lazy because I do not get pleasure out of anything. No pleasure in playing games, reading books, drawing, walking my dogs, talking to my friends, even calling or emailing my loving boyfriend. I get very little out of life. And he wants to MARRY ME. Yet I dont plan on being around.. I dont even know who I am anymore. I dont have passions or interests other than watching the TV mindlessly ugh.

I've had jobs and I've gone to community college here and there but I have ZERO motivation to do anything. I'm working on getting a drivers license. I'm taking slow steps to get where I wanna be in life again. Even if I dont want to be here and dont have plans to be here, I still need to get my life together just incase I somehow make it to age 30.

Food tastes like nothing. Music doesn't sound enjoyable. It just all feels like nothing and a big waste of time.

I never thought id make it this far and now I'm suffering the consequences because I DID NOT PLAN when I was a teenager. I've been rotting inside my body since age 13. Its like I died at a young age and now I'm a parasite piloting a dead body.

1lwv7hx,Maybe I’ll just do it,"I’m 17 and I honestly can’t take this shit anymore, I thought my life would get better if I started trying harder but it hasn’t, I’m sick of not being enough for anyone around me.

I’m tired of my dad being disappointed in me just because I don’t try as hard as he did when he was my age, and even when I do I get a “nice” without even a glance coming my way. I love him but I’m tired of every single time I get into a relationship or get a good grade I try to get his approval, to be seen, to matter. And it’s ironic because growing up I saw this man maybe twice every 2 weeks if I was lucky. I’m tired that I feel like a second family to him because now he has his new girlfriend and I really like her and her daughters but he seems to care more about her than he ever did about me. I’m tired of my sisters telling me that he just doesn’t know how to show his emotions but he seems to do a pretty good job with them. Why the fuck should I be different? Why the fuck am I the one always left behind? I get it he did have his troubles growing up and I’m not saying he’s a deadbeat or anything he has a pretty good life but I feel like I’m not even a fucking part of it. I feel like I’m just labelled as “his only son” and not one of his children, I’m just a fucking spare part he made to make my sister happy. I’m just the big fucking joke at family gatherings and family dinners. I feel like I don’t matter, no matter what I do he’s always disappointed. I feel like he doesn’t fucking love me like he loves my sisters, at least he sure as hell does a shit job at showing it.

I’m so grateful of my mother protecting me and praising me for every little thing and trying to make me feel like the most special person in the world but I know it’s bullshit and it’s just because she’s afraid I’ll get bad again, she’s afraid I’ll start having panic attacks again because I was too fucked up growing up that I can’t even control myself in tense situations, I used to, now I just lash out every time I’m pushed to my limit. I love my mother, but she’s also the same mother who beat me when I was younger because she had anger issues, the same mother who suffocated me because I couldn’t fold a piece of cloth right, the same mother who made me go to bed hungry because she didn’t feel like cooking. She was depressed for almost 5 years because of the loss of my grandfather and I absolutely get that but I hated having to take care of myself and my little sister because she “couldn’t” (mind you she beat me before she was depressed, when she was depressed I was already a bit older so she wouldn’t do much for most of the time other than screaming at me constantly). I don’t blame her for being depressed and (thankfully) she’s gotten much better now and I genuinely thank her for all her efforts she’s the person I love the most in this world but I genuinely can’t stand being told “Oh you have so much potential” “Oh you’re so smart” when it’s clearly not true because if it was I would be in a much better situation than the one I am in right now, I would’ve tried harder in life so I would be better off than I am right this second.

I love my parents but I hated growing up waking up to them fighting and going to sleep with them fighting, I love my parents but I hated their divorce, I love my parents but I hated taking the screaming and beating for my younger sister, I love my parents but I hate myself.

I hate how I always push everyone away because I’m too fucked up in the head to give them what they deserve. I hate how I always give too much to the wrong people. I hate how I can’t choose good friendships. I hate the fact that I can/want to give so much but somehow I never seem to give it to the right people. I genuinely hate myself. I hate how I can’t take anyone for granted because everyone seems to leave right when I think I’m doing better.

I thought it would get better, and it did, but it just got bad again, maybe worse than it’s ever been and I don’t know how to make it stop, I’m spinning out of control and I can’t find anything to hold on to. I used to hate smoking and drinking, now I smoke way too much (when I drink because I can’t smoke without drinking) and I drink way too much every time I go out to try and get away from my issues. I always see people going out and getting drunk for fun but I can’t seem to do that, I’m not having fun when I go out, I just can’t drink at home so going out is my only option.

This is mostly just a big ass rant and I don’t really expect anyone to read the whole thing. I just wanted to leave this here in case I do it.

To everyone who’s thinking about suicide, it’s probably not a good choice but at this point I don’t really see any other solution.

I seem to love everyone for who they are but hate myself because of things that are out of my control and I am aware of this but there ain’t a single fucking thing I can do about it.

Also don’t let other people dismiss your feelings just because you can laugh here and there.

If anyone actually read this long, I hope you have a good day/night and I hope your problems get better. No matter who you are.

1lwuquy,Just lost,"I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore. (Sorry for this being so long)

I used to have all the answers. I knew exactly what I wanted and where I wanted to go. But after setbacks, I feel lost. I've become someone I admire for surviving, but also someone I look down on because I'm not who I thought I'd be.

I grew up in a strict household. My parents didn't let me do anything except study. I managed decent grades that were just enough to keep them off my back. Still, they were always on me. I had to argue for everything - what clothes I could wear, whether I could go out, even having hobbies. It was suffocating.

Then COVID happened, and everything got worse, the arguing intensified. When lockdown eased, I didn't want to go out because I knew the shitstorm waiting when I got home. They'd yell at me for enjoying a few hours outside when the rest of the time I was stuck in bed, depressed, mostly because of them.

I wanted out. Somehow, I got a scholarship to study abroad in the UK. I'm usually a pessimist, but I thought I could handle it. I didn't know how hard it would be.

A week before I left, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. The medication made me exhausted. I had to work to pay rent and bills while studying. With only 20 hours a week allowed, I was barely scraping by financially, mentally, emotionally plus dealing with depression no one believed was real. By the time people acknowledged it, it was too late. I was breaking down over the smallest things, carrying everything alone.

After being in the UK for a while, I realized how deep that depression was. I also got a shoulder injury that still hasn't healed. I tried to build friendships, but most people were fake. Eventually, I had no one to talk to. The loneliness was brutal, made worse because I had to keep holding myself together.

For a year, I felt completely alone. Everyone I knew was back home, and they didn't understand what I was going through. I couldn't ask my parents for money, couldn't make more, couldn't pay bills. I tried making friends, but never really clicked with anyone.

After university ended, things improved. I could work more hours and cover my expenses. I found better friends. My depression lifted, and my anxiety became easier to manage. But then I hit another wall, finding a job.

I want to start my career, but I'm stuck in hospitality. I've tried networking, tweaking my CV, reaching out - nothing has worked. I've sent out over 5,000 applications, and the two job offers I received were taken away because of my visa. I feel like I'm going nowhere.

I know I'm capable. I've always proven myself - surviving a toxic home, getting through depression, building a life in a new country. But I've always ended up in places that didn't help me grow.

And now, I have six months left on my visa, and barely any relevant experience since graduating. Plus my landlord has asked me to move out because they’re selling the house. So I’m moving to London to take a risk but I don’t have a job I want or a place to live. It's probably a dumb decision but I thought I'd make it anyway. I feel like everything I do ends up like this, always on the edge of collapse. And when my visa runs out, I’ll have to return to a place that no longer feels like home and start all over again.

I feel the depression is coming back. Well, I don't think it ever went away because my circumstances never truly changed. I don't feel like doing anything. I procrastinate all day and then don't feel like sleeping, and all everyone around me says is try, don't give up. Well I have, and I just want to give up.

Hello,

Long time depressive addict here at the end of the rope

I have 8mg xanax and 15 x 8mg dilaudid pills, for s grand total of 120mg of hydromorphone. Pretty high opiate tolerance and i take 23mg of methadone daily of which my last dose was 5 hours ago. No tolerance to xanax tho. I plan on taking all the xanax and shooting up 48mg of the dilaudid ( as much as I think I could fit in the rig) might attempt a 56mg shoot tho and will probably make a big ass line out of the rest of the dilaudid and snorted them.

Do you think this will be enough to do the deed but not enough that It was clearly intentional rather than accidental. Don't bother trying to talk me out of it its going down regardless

We are like 3 weeks behind and I got denied to work. But my husband has to go in.... so I'll be at home alone. Everytime I signed up, I get denied. I don't know if I suck at my job. I don't know.

1lwtidb,Back in the rut. How can I escape?,"I just stumbled on this subreddit in between bouts of crying and pillow screaming. I'm a 36 year old human who had a chronic illness. I suffer from chronic fatigue as well as chronic severe pain. I also suffer from multiple mental illnesses, including depression. Lately, things have gotten worse. Back in March, I had a dream which caused a break from reality and thus caused me to go cold turkey on all my medications. My life went haywire, I told psych, and was slowly reintroduced to the important ones. Some, such as my nightmare and sleep meds, did not get reintroduced. I'm now back on my usual doses and, honestly, I don't feel well at all. I'm very anxious still, crying, angry, and in pain.

Recently, I had to reschedule my therapy appointment for family reasons and won't see them until the end of the month. It's been a month since I saw them last so a lot is built up. I've thrown myself into my video game as a distraction, but that no longer seems to work now.

I am mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausted. I'm so tired yet I don't do anything. I can't work, I struggle with exercise, I have a poor diet, and I'm addicted to soda yet again. I've quit before because I have poor impulse control around this certain beverage. But when I started to get depressed again I picked it back up. I've put on a scary amount of weight in just the past 2 months. My belly sticks out so far it scares me and I feel like in passing people might think I'm a pregnant person even though that's not even possible. And, quite frankly, I want to just sleep and never wake up.

I desperately want to get out of this rut that I have found myself in. However, I have become overwhelmed by my symptoms and don't know where to start. For the past week or so I've done nothing but play my game with my partner until they leave to work and then I just lay on the sofa and watch YouTube until existing is so bad I have to get up and move to my bed.

I feel ashamed. I feel broken. I feel worthless. I feel I'm no longer enough.",1752195411.0,2,4
1lwth2u,Courage,"I don't understand why suicide is treated as weakness if it is incredibly difficult to find the courage to withdraw.

1lwth03,I don’t want to be happy,"For so long, I thought that I wanted to be happy, couldn’t, and that notion made me even more depressed. That I couldn’t ever achieve happiness.

Today, I was frustrated with my thoughts and started pushing back - what if all the anxiety about my future and sadness I feel thinking about all the things that could go wrong, didn’t go wrong. What if the worst of the worst didn’t happen, and I could live in the present, appreciate what I have now, and start feeling happy?

I then admitted maybe the answer to all of my back and forth thoughts, is that I don’t WANT to be happy, and find ways to continue to be anxious and depressed? As if the thought of no longer being depressed one day feels like losing a piece of myself or one I’m more comfortable with.

I don’t enjoy ANYTHING. Like trust me i actually tried and i found out that i don’t enjoy anything in life no more since my depression. I’m just….There. Existing and breathing oxygen but I don’t LIVE.

Haven’t been myself for the past 9 years (and i’m 24 now). I put up a good fight i think, but now i’m tired. It’s worse than prison or cancer i just want to fucking die already and finally STOP suffering.

Somedays i try to cry because i think it may help but nothing comes out. Idk why but I’m literally unable to cry and its so frustrating. I have no friends, family or colleagues to talk to.

I ruined my own life and i’m the only one to blame for it. I was not abused, bullied, raped etc…i’m just worthless.

1lwsrzu,I’m tired.,"I’m 21, completely burnt out, and I feel nothing anymore  even though I have everything I used to wish for.

Growing up, I struggled with severe depression and anxiety. I could barely leave the house, let alone talk to anyone. I spent my teenage years overwhelmed by intense emotions sadness, fear, panic to the point where it completely shaped who I was.

Now I’m 21. And I guess, on paper, things look like they’ve improved: I have a job that pays well, I have some stability, and I finally have the ability to do the things I always thought I wanted.

But now I feel nothing. No sadness, no joy, no motivation just numb. It’s like I’m watching life happen from behind a glass window. I’m gliding through the motions, disconnected from everything around me, and even from myself. I don’t know who I am anymore without the constant emotional chaos. I’ve burned out so hard that EVEN feeling bad is gone.

The strangest part? The depression and anxiety that ruled my life for so long suddenly faded away but instead of peace, all that’s left is emptiness. I can’t even enjoy the small things. It feels like I’ve survived everything I went through only to end up unable to actually live.

I’m so tired. Not just physically deep in my soul.
And I honestly don’t know how to keep going if nothing feels real anymore.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of emotional numbness after years of depression?

1lwsfnd,Can I get a bit of advice on what to do?,"I think I might need a therapy because I am experiencing suicidal thoughts and I struggle with depression on a daily basis. This is motivated by religion and my upbringing. No one in my family can get along with each other, I try to be nice, I try to get along but it’s difficult and I hate myself for it. One of my parents have Alzheimers and it can be a living hell sometimes, today she went outside and was trying to talk or harass as my parent says to someone across the street for whatever reason, she thinks they are our friends and has to be worried about them, now for the past few months she thinks pictures can talk and are real and that people on the tv can see her. This is not the best situation to be in because judging by my upbringing there was always arguments and confusion that’s really consistent, some prejudice/hate towards other groups (certain non Christian’s and ethnic groups (Buddhist, Muslims, Indian (unless they’re Christian’s and gays), and many cartoon shows and movies being labeled as demonic which seems to just get progressively worse gradually although it probably has been stabilized, there’s not much of a decline or improvement to these beliefs and it’s a major reason why I now have trust issues with my parents and I hide lots of things I do. They think numbers determines your fate and future, Last year I picked a number 13 for a sport and they didn’t like it because it’s associated with bad dates and that nobody would choose, i wanted a number 10 but it was either not an option or it was taken so i choose d the 13 because it was closer to the number and nobody bats and eye, whats  ironic is that the number 7 which they love is the October 7th attack and the number 1 is the world war 2, not so good is it? Additionally, they think that animals are associated with stuff and are demonic (flies, lizards,  cats, dogs, bats, owls, unicorns(doesn’t exist and most definitely snakes which was accelerated from a single religious sermon) I guess most of other people always have a place in their heart for pets but mine despises most of them. Most family members my parents have, have really bad relations with, the last time I’ve seen a family member was when i was 2 or 3. It just bothers me how easy others have it with family and mines is just extremely seperated. Never realized that some of these things are affecting me in a way. I just want a normal life but I hate my parents worldviews and actions and it does play a huge role in depression for me idk if it’s normal or not. I just don’t care about what other people do, I’m just trying to maybe improve life or learn. I don’t feel like they listen to me on the areas when it comes to worldviews, the Bible itself doesn’t even mention most of these things I’m stating so that’s even more ridicules.",1752192297.0,2,3

Sometimes I worry I might have too many interests to balance. I have poor control in my life, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I strongly believe I have depression though I had not been diagnosed by it. And, because of that, I just feel empty all of the time. This started since I was young and now I'm 16 and still can't control anything in my life.

Because I feel empty most of the time, I just get the sudden urge to do something, anything just to appease the emptiness. Sometimes I wake up and choose drawing, sometimes music making, sometimes coding, baking, sculpting, crocheting, playing the piano, thinking about life choices (this one's great 😃), and most of the time, I just wake up and want to do nothing. But doing nothing just make my soul itch and makes me uncomfortable. I just need to do something. I've never been into sports mainly because I am deathly afraid to go outside my house and socialize with people so maybe that's one factor. But nevertheless, I just get INTENSE and I mean INTENSE desires to do something to relieve stress and when I encounter more stress in that hobby, I lash out and stop doing the thing (mostly happens with coding and cooking🫠).

I’ve dry fired multiple times with the muzzle right at nose level. It’s still unnerving pointing the barrel directly at my face. Desensitization is going to be necessary if I want to go through with it.

Despite this surefire method, I still have apprehensions. What if it somehow doesn’t kill me? Will I feel the pain, even if it’s only for a moment? What will occur directly following the explosion? Will I hear it? See it? I’m almost certain I will be met with the pitch darkness of non-existence as soon as I pull the trigger. No pain, bang, or lights, just blackness. Yet still, I have fear.

Finally manning up and killing myself is going to take more time, of that much I am certain. Loading a shell, chambering it, and switching the safety off is going to be a herculean task. Actually pulling the trigger is going to be something else entirely. It gives me shivers just thinking about it.

1lwn6t7,Im at the end of my tether at this point,"This is a burner account since some people I know irl know my main account. I wont specify too much to avoid being identified, since I know there’s chances of people recognising me via details. I am however graduating high school (not what it’s called here but Im trying to avoid recognition), and I am out of reasons to live. all mental disorders mentioned have been officially diagnosed.

Sorry for layout below, it’s late at night and Im too delirious to do much about it and Im pretty much just writing whatever spills out of my head at this point.

Ive been fighting shitty situation after shitty situation since I can remember. Parents started out physically and mentally abusive (in ways normalised where I am) and a myriad of undiagnosed and/or under treated mental disorders caused my mental state to fracture, literally. Bouts of memory loss and alters formed when I was around 4-5 years old due to this. I had to effectively bootstrap enough of the field of psychology to be able to string myself back together, and as a result, I have never known mental stability for more than 8 hours, for 2 periods. Sounds like made up bullshit Im aware, but same goes for most of my life. I was diagnosed with adhd and autism around this time, but the diagnosis was never explained to me. My early childhood was riddled with incredibly fucked social interactions (turned to bullying to cope at some point, thankfully no longer the case for 6 years), constant spiralling and hallucinations and “hallucinations” (which were actually alters losing their shit due to the constant stress), underpaid social workers who I think(?) wanted to help but couldnt, incessant gaslighting and mental torment from my mother, which was mostly in the form of neglect, but on the unfortunate occasions which she was present, usually ending up with my ass being beat whenever we had a conversation until I was old enough to fight back. One notable instance was when I attempted suicide in the middle of class but didnt strangle myself correctly, and told my mom why in presence of school staff, that being the absolute disconnect between us. She agreed to meet me in the middle and this was the first time I ever felt mental stability. She proceeded to never tdo this. Same goes for my dad, except he beat me less, was definitely incapable of gaslighting, not against, and was more of an enabler. Constant comparisons to my sister ensured I would always be trying to prove myself to people no matter what even today. I was NEVER good enough. Failures with insults and successes practically ignored. REALLY didnt help that ideas of being trans femme were bouncing around my brain since I was 6, so some part of myself was definitely chasing approval due to “approval=equal to sister=girl” or some similar line of logic. The lack of explanation of autism and adhd came back to bite my ass on a daily basis until I googled autism mid panic attack in my parent’s common language (not english), which they used derogatorily frequently for years. the lack of explanation (among other things) led to being socially inept, and I only ever had at most 2 proper social connections in person at any given time (note the in person part for later). I know for a fact that teachers had at least one specific guy be “friends” with me so that I would have some company. We did become real friends eventually (I only found out about this fact a few years in) but we drifted apart because he kept making transphobic comments about other people and I am a coward and opted to simply stop talking to him because I was terrified he’d somehow tell my incredibly transphobic family somehow, despite having no way to contact them (anxiety disorder is obvious). I have very high proficiency in many stem subjects, winning a bucket of awards as time went on. None of them were ever enough though. My parents never acknowledged any of them, or even made the effort to find out what they were about.academic burnout has been happening for a decade ish at this point. Online friends were mostly a terrible experience, got groomed twice to do heinous shit (none sexual, all war crimes), and I became unwittingly complicit in major online scandals and the invention of forms of targeted cyberbullying with 3 unconfirmed suicides and at least 5 confirmed cases of resultant depression as a result. All this was to seek social connections (and also because I hate pedophiles, which is who the cyberbullying method was invented to target)
I had three close friends I made as a teenager, in order:
1. we met due to a design competition, team based. She managed the team and I spearheaded the design. We communicated a lot as a result and talked a lot. She was the first person I ever opened up to who was someone I knew irl. I developed a crush about 8 months in. We drifted apart after an alter confessed (against the rest of the system’s decisions) at 3 am.
2. We met at a conference and started talking basically on a whim, we started talking for a week and then started dating for 10 months. this was the happiest time of my life, and the other one of 2 times I ever experienced a stable mental state. We were an hour apart physically, and go to different schools, but met up every weekend and regularly in holidays. We called whenever we couldnt meet. I suspected they also had autism and pushed them to investigate, since I knew they’d never pursue it due to parents who wanted to avoid diagnosis. during an exam season, we called less due to needing to focus on academics. We also had 2 consecutive weekends which we couldnt meet up due to coincidence. When we did finally meet, I sensed something was off. turns out my hunch on them having autism was right, and they recieved diagnosis. Most of the stuff they knew relating to autism, especially masking, were stuff I told them. They were afraid that our relationship was a masking mechanism (to this day nobody who knows about it understands how the fuck this conclusion was reached) and they wanted some space to think on it, and broke up with me a week later, promising me they’d tell me when they figured themselves out and we could get back together if we still loved eachother. I still love them. I havent heard from them since.
3. We met during a different exam season than the one above, and started talking more and more. They are a lot more sensitive than the average person, which isnt something wrong with them, but of note is I am very blunt in natural speech and I have always had issues managing impact of words. We grew closer and closer over time as friends and friends only (I did have a period of limerance which I struggled to identify if it was romantic, or in this case not, since I had a grand total of 4 friends prior). This lasted 2 years. I confided in this person everything that’s said in this post and more, except for youll see. We had some fights, early on it was mostly due to my suicidal ass and they made the mistake of reporting me to the school (which is known to handle these cases as well as a screwdriver handles the demon core), but later on it was mostly my social ineptitude accidentally triggering them (most of these incidents took place late at night). 3 weeks ago, they explicitly told me they didnt want to be friends anymore due to things I said (and very much regret saying but couldnt bring myself to bring the topic up due to fear of confrontation until it was too late). This set off the spiral Im currently on. we havent spoken since and Im paralysed with fear as I want to apologise for all the damage I have done but I just cant bring myself to hit send.

Ive tried to kill myself literally hundreds of times but have either pulled myself from the edge, or have someone else pull me. Ive been caught trying 18 times and have been in the psych ward a few times as a result. Every attempt I pulled myself back, I was thinking of the pain my friends would feel. I dont have any friends to feel that pain anymore and as a result, I have run out of reasons to live. My family is against core parts of my identity and are trying to act nice now after a decade of torture which I cannot bring myself to forgive for, Im completely burnt out and nothing gives me real happiness, just fleeting molecules of seretonin from doom scrolling whole rotting in bed. I have no friends left to live for. Any future prospects will require me to work forward in this hell for minimum all of undergrad since I picked a course thats a sausage fest and Im unlikely to find anyone who can even handle me at this point.

I wanted to call someone tonight but for once in a decade I have nobody to call. So here I am spilling my heart out to reddit.

1lwmze6,Depression really don't go away easily and that's okay,"Its quite hard nowadays to rid oneself of depression and anxiety alike when the world is already drowning in it.

It gets very easy to suddenly get lost and not recognize yourself, it gets incredibly easy for you to question your existence in general and it spiral deeper and deeper until you feel like shit and couldn't come back

It's a hot take but I don't believe we as a society takes depression seriously enough. This is definitely a generalisation and it's a flaw for sure but am I entirely wrong? People only cares about it when it suits them or when they feel like it.

I believe the current generation has got to be one of the most depressed people to ever exist and that can entirely be wrong but statistics and just direct assesment alone don't lie
It's genuinely difficult to find someone nowadays who's not struggling mentally with some sort of depression, anxiety or just a lot of insecurities that cause them to beat themselves up mentally.

I think it's sad that so many people have to struggle with this as they grow up and as they live and some couldn't even speak on it in fear of being judged or just because they think very little of themselves. I know cause I'm one of them. It's a painful thing really. Depression for me personally has made me feel empty inside and I generally can't be bothered with social settings. I spend a lot of time self loathing but that's nothing new. But it's not entirely bad.

The usual advice you get from people don't work when it comes to depression, cause really from my experience the real solution truly lies within, somewhere. Cause it's an issue that is deeply personal and telling people to go outside and get a hobby isn't gonna magically help them

what I've learned after spending most of my teenage years loathing myself and having to deal with extreme depression is that the moment you find the things that trigger your drive to keep pushing forward, that's where you feel alive again and it's a surreal feeling. I felt like depression for me is partially the feeling of emptiness and loss and a general sense of ""I have no purpose in life"" and a lot of ""i wanna off myself so badly"" so when I finally found what fills in these gaps, I can't turn back anymore. I wanna keep going cause Im finally, genuinely living again.

To me the real answer on how to cure one's depression is to find what makes you wanna keep going forward, it's something that makes you happy, occupy your mind often and fills you with a sense of purpose. a clock that slows down can always start ticking again if it really wishes to. It just needs the proper battery.

What keeps me going is art in general and it takes me a long time to know that, what keeps you going might be entirely different. But it will take you sometime and a lot of self reflection, it will also require the will to pull yourself out of the gutter. I don't have anyone to help me with any of that when I was down on the floor but somehow I managed to stand up on my feet again after multiple years of trying. I strongly believe that eventually, someone who fall can eventually get up again. And I hope whoever read this who's down on the ground, feeling hopeless, depressed, anxious and just generally despises themselves will someday find their trigger to keep going so that they can stand up again.

I don't really know who will read this or what you're going through but I do know you're capable of being happy again and you deserve to be. ",1752178581.0,6,1

I feel so disconnected, like no one truly cares, and everyone is too caught up in their own lives. I know I can’t change that, but it hurts to realize there isn’t a single person left in my life with whom I can genuinely open up, someone who would actually listen and not just hear me out and brush it off. I’ve been through two breakups, and the first one took a huge toll on my mental health. Since then, things have only seemed to spiral downwards. I somehow managed to pull myself out of that dark phase and gave love another chance, only to end up heartbroken again. Even though I feel I’m more mature this time, it still weighs so heavily on my heart, and I can feel my mental health slipping again. I don’t even have the energy to socialize anymore, even though I long for a real, deep connection. This sense of disconnection frightens me, craving closeness yet feeling so far away from everyone. This pretentious nature of mine fades away when I am all by myself at the end of the day, I pretend that I am strong and that being alone doesn’t affect me, but deep down I know exactly how it feels, and it hurts a lot. I feel stuck in this cycle, and it’s starting to affect other areas of my life too. My motivation has dropped, my studies are suffering, and I’m constantly plagued by self doubt and the feeling that I’m just not good enough.

I was depressed for 2 years, pretty much isolated myself from everything, then I made a conscious effort to improve my life- therapy/exercise/ going out more. It seemed to work. But when I started rebuilding I was confronted with what I had abandoned. No one trusted me at work they just never expect me to complete anything, so they don’t give me anything to work on. For my friends I’m not fun anymore so I see the unintentional exclusion that happens. My family looks at me like I’ll break at any minute so I feel like I’m in the periphery- I’m being looked at but not really seen because they know if they ask too much, they might actually find something concerning.

My cousin asked me why I felt the need to get hammered several times a week. I'm taking a new antidepressant that's really helped me a lot.

I felt like that was too dismal of an answer.

My memories were just me sitting in my classroom,daydreaming,going back home,going to school,sitting in my classroom,day dreaming,going back home.

I act like i had split myself into multiple people just so i can talk to someone...i was no more than 12.

The reason why I remember some special occasions and people think i have great memory is because those times are so rare to happen and so little that i remember it like it has happened a million time.

I remembered those moments since I thought people cared for me,but they remember nothing about me.

“Wow you remember that? Wow i did that?”

What they remember is my face,and how fat i was and that i did nothing but sit alone.

My trauma,was me being lonely and neglected to the point i was in a daydream,every,single,day.

For my entire teenage life.

I had a thought,on why i feel conscious only after i turn 20 and made some friends.

I still can’t express my feelings and emotions and stories to people cuz they will just dismiss it and say “pray”.

“Grow up youre not a kid anymore”
Am I really an adult.

To the god my family worships,your worshippers did this to me,protect my ass yourself i dont need to pray for it,you’re the creator.

I don’t own a pet to make it beg for food and beg to come inside the house,and then send it to the pound for not liking me after the neglect.

I don’t belong to any religion,any race,any culture. I never existed until now, I just happened to have the genes and look of a certain race. But inside I connect to nothing but the people who have suffered the same fate as me.

However, my mother is always telling me I’m lazy and do the bare minimum. She’s frustrated seeing me without a spark for life, not caring for my health or future. Even when I start to get better, she tells me I’m not doing enough which spirals me back into self hatred.

I’m super sensitive and have a distorted sense of reality, unrealistic expectations of how people should behave and how life should be.

So tell me, is depression truly cured through pure willpower and hard work? My mother and my therapist always tell me this is the way out, I have to choose to be better and go into grind mode. But 7 years of hearing this, and never have I made any progress trying this method. For me, what I attempted (and started to work before I gave up) was taking small steps and trying to be kinder to myself. I know my mom is trying to help, but telling me I need to try harder when I’m already doing something is so demotivating.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I have attempted so many times to escape depression but always go back to it and it gets worse every time. I self sabotage and quickly lose sight of my goals.

So I'm deeply planning my suicide. I don't know why I'm writing this because I already feel like no one can understand but oh well.
Im currently in a recovery house, recently lost a relationship that was falling apart, she left and it was my fault. 3 years of someone that made me the happiest I've ever been and now she hates me. I tell everyone before I get close that I'm no good, that I don't deserve to be loved and they fight it, but with time they see what I'm talking about and my heart is just left more broken and my feelings about myself more confirmed.
Considering I lost her, I really have nothing, no family, no friends, no loved ones, no one will be hurt by me killing myself. My birthday is the 30th and hers the 31st...for some reason I'm holding hope I'll hear from her but I doubt it. I'll be finishing my program and getting a chunk of money this time next month. The plan is to get that money, find access to Fentanyl (I've never done opiates) and take an insane amount of the pills, alcohol and weed in a hotel room. Hopefully the fentanyl pills are enough to kill me, if that somehow fails plan b is to look for a gun and plan C to jump in front of speeding traffic.
I've heard all the cliches about how we have the power to change it all, but im broken and I'm only gonna make it worse and feel more pain. I know it's crazy to kill myself over a Girl but she's the best I've ever and I'll ever have so if the best is behind me, if she's just gonna move and and fall in love with someone else and forget about me, what points is there in living.

There's times I can feel my cheeks going up but I don't feel any joy.

Since I've been depressed since a young age I seriously don't know how to even make normal facial expressions. I'm teaching myself how to even make basic expressions. I blank out no matter how hard I try to be present and it's affecting my studies. My friends all say that I'm their closest friend and I was there for them and they're ready to listen to me 24/7 but I seriously don't want them to be my therapists.

I have really supportive family and friends but I still often don't feel comfortable around them for anything. I don't know what to even express other than feeling numb or randomly crying. Despite all this I kept telling myself that it's better to deal with negative things early on in life than a crucial stage. Now I don't  know anymore. My family's seriously affected cause of my education and depression. Despite a mostly normal mood, I'm always walking around in eggshells that I mostly avoid stepping out of my room. There's so many things that no matter how hard I tried to convey to them it never worked out. My family is really helpful but I'm tired to even talk. I'm just exhausted and just want to sleep 24/7.",1752152538.0,1,0
1lwfv2g,What do people want from me?,"I have given people all i have.

My love, my money, my time. What more do they want? Do they want me to cut out a piece of my flesh and give it to them?

I am so so tired.

I have a horrible family life.

I had really bad experiences with friends.

I thought i had made some good ones this time. Some people who were actually my friends.

I gave them everything. I was there for them when they needed me. I fed them. I helped them in any way I could. I went out of my way to do things they asked me to do even when I had to suffer for it.

So why? I have nothing else left to give?

What more do i give so that it will be enough?

What more do i give so people will love me?

Why is it so easy for people to find friends and family that love and care for them?? But I can't seem to find any of that at all.

1lwfmno,What are poor people supposed to do?,"*Rant*

It's socially unacceptable to talk about your problems with your friends because that's ""trauma dumping"". They say go tell a professional. But you can't afford therapy, and you can't tell professionals you meet normally (aka as friends or dates) because they ""don't listen to peoples problems when I'm not at work."" So basically, if you're poor, you don't tell anyone and suffer alone. Only other options are to write an autobiography or song or go on some reality show where you talk about your suffering in great detail. I've never understood this logic. Yeah of course no one HAS to listen to anyones problems but I don't understand people who claim to be your  ""friend"" but don't want to hear any of it but then expect to listen to THEIR problems, or who just call you a trauma dumper and say ""tell a professional,"" or will then go watch a reality show about how horrible someone's life is, or listen to songs about it, or whatever. People have selective empathy, it feels like. They don't give a fuck about their ""friends"" yet care about random strangers on TV for some damn reason.

Edit: I want to add on that I myself have been on the receiving end of feeling overwhelmed by friend's feelings, and then needing a break or some space when I have told them there isn't anything I can do to support them, or being asked for things far beyond what I am capable of doing. This isn't the situation I'm talking about. I'm talking about friendships/dating where you aren't allowed to say anything negative, even for a short amount of time.",1752161268.0,25,7
1lwflf1,Help,"I wanted to share a story of mine with you all today. The story is about an issue that I have been facing with my family for the last year and a half. So after my grandma died, my uncle and one of my cousins came over to our house and started living in our house. Our house is a 3 bedroom apartment. And this happened in 2023. So during the 2023, I was in SSC class 10. So from January 2023 to July 2023, I have suffered tremendous pressure with all this stuff at home. Especially in May, things got so bad that I couldn't focus on my studies without crying so much. So many things happened during that time that I can't even forget what was the truth and what was not during that time.

So, after the 23, after 23 and everything happened in August and September, October, November, we like, were good. I was recovering from this state. But in late December, 23, unfortunately my uncle died. And after my uncle died, that cousin was supposed to be staying over at our house for rest of eternity or rest of our life. But I couldn't take that. Like, what's done in the past trauma I had in May. I even visited a psychiatrist just to like cope up with everything. And my levels actually dropped by a lot because of this incident and stuff. So, yeah, after 293 December, I want to go into more details about what happened in 293 December. In that time, I was in so much agony that I cried in 293 December, 20 December, 21 December, 22 December. These 3 days were the most fucked up times of my life. I tried, attempted suicide 3 times. I smoked 60 cigarettes in 3 days. I cried. I reached out to a suicidal helpline. I tried of myself 5 times with those 3 times, failing and 5 times thinking about suicide. And a lot of things happened after that. Like, I was crying in so much pain. I was in so much pain in that time that you can't even imagine how much pain I was in that time. It was like, yeah, you are not this, but they didn't see what was coming. Like, I cried so much in that time. Nobody saw me in that state.

So, after that, and after that in 24, I believe that was 6th December, he came into our house again. In that time, that morning of 6th December, I had consumed 20 antidepressant pills. I have to be, for some reason I didn't get anything. But those 20 antidepressant pills still haunt me that I got so much. I slept like a baby for 3 days after that. Now, why I'm sharing this to you is because, like, today an incident happened that I wanted some advice from you all, like, how should I have to react, like, my reaction towards the incident, and some reflection. Sorry for if there's, like, any scratch grammar, because I'm, like, writing this with the Y structure. So, there may be some, like, grammatical errors, correct me if I'm wrong.

.So, today, actually, that cousin again came to our house. After seeing him, I got a bit of rage, started hitting my mother, and my aunt, who stays over with us. I started swearing at her. After that, she called my father. Remember, my father actually hit me in the head in 2023, February, for this incident. That reason that I don't like them at all. My mother and everybody knew, like, that he hit me, but nobody said a word, thinking that this was okay. I know everything is like... But, am I... I know I am in the wrong. Like, if I told this to somebody, they would be like, Yeah, you're wrong, but you're not seeing it for my right. Because, I have been... Like, all these incidents are... Like, I can't take this. So, this is one of the things that I can't control myself for.

if i get texts from them, it's either cuz they need to rant/ need help or it's about a volunteer opportunity we could go together, which is nice, but volunteering feels like a chore now so it's basically like being asked to call in for work.

i either bottle up or bawl my eyes out everyday, there's no in between.

We’ve had many talks about this and I know he’s tired of repeating himself, and I say I will work on it but it’s just hard for me. I’m bipolar, so I suffer from depressive episodes and manic episodes. I rarely have manic episodes and that’s when my sex drive is the highest. I’m usually depressed, and when I get depressed I get very depressed, I also have anxiety. Lately I’ve been in a very deep depression, with suicidal thoughts. I am working in a job that has me very stressed and I can’t get out of it which has only made more depressed. I’m just not in the best space right now.

Last time we talked about it, he said that we were not going to have that conversation again and that if he feels like we need to have that conversation again, maybe it’s best to break up. I don’t want to lose him which is why I’m looking for advice on what I can do to be a better girlfriend. This week we have only had sex once and I feel extremely bad.

1lwd17f,"I've been trying to fix my life, but now I'm about to lose the only thing that can calm my mind.","At the beginning, I'll tell you my story, I just want to get it off my chest. It might be chaotic, it's my first time doing this, and my head is a mess.

Even as a kid in elementary school, I had trouble making friends. I had classmates I talked to, but all the friendships were limited to school, outside of it, I spent most of my free time alone. I read a lot of books and visited the school library every other day. I was the best student in the class, maybe even in the whole school, everything came easily to me. I kept hearing how talented I was and how much I would achieve in life.

Middle school was different, I was often picked on and had various problems finding my place in the new environment, but I managed to get by. Everything changed at the beginning of high school. I had my first serious panic attack, completely out of the blue, while I was home alone. It was one of those days I'll never forget. I didn't tell anyone about it because I knew no one would take it seriously. From that moment on, everything changed. I started avoiding stressful situations, skipped a lot of school, and wandered the city for hours. I have no idea how I managed to finish the first year. In the second year, it didn't work out, I had so many absences that after a while they simply expelled me. At home, of course, there was anger and yelling. I was the biggest disappointment in the family.

My father had a small home business, which I helped him with for the next few years. I didn't do anything else, I had no friends, and I spent my free time reading books, playing games, and watching lots of movies and TV shows. When I was 23, my mom got sick, and a year later, she passed away. Two years after that, one of my dad's friends helped him meet someone new. The home business pretty much collapsed, and I had to find a job. With no education or experience, I didn't have many options. I found a simple manual job in a factory, which of course I didn't enjoy, but I had to earn money. My father moved out and started a new life, from that point on, I lived alone.

Over the years, I learned how to manage my panic attacks, but the social anxiety remained just as strong. I avoided interacting with people whenever I could, even at work. After a few years, things at the factory got worse, many people left, and I decided to hand in my resignation as well. I had some savings and a few ideas for an online business. At first, things were going well, but the complete isolation from the world took a serious toll on my mental health. I tried different antidepressants, but apart from the side effects, they didn't help me at all.

I stopped earning money, and my savings slowly started to disappear. I was in the worst place I'd ever been in my life, and I had no idea what to do about it. Everything lost its meaning. I realized I was completely alone, I had ruined my relationship with my family long ago, I had no friends, no one. Holidays felt like just ordinary days, and I often forgot about my own birthday. At some point, I started selling the books I had collected over the years. It was incredibly painful because I had always dreamed of having a home library. But I had no choice, I ended up selling around 400 books. I also sold other things, anything I possibly could. Less than a month ago, I managed to get myself somewhat together and started looking for a job. I've already been to two interviews, but unfortunately without success. I have a third one next week.

All these years, I somehow managed to keep up with the bills. Sometimes I paid them very late, but I always found a way to cover them. However, this year has been much harder, and now I've fallen seriously behind. So much so that in two days, they're going to cut off my electricity. For four months, I've been submitting requests to delay the payment, explaining my difficult situation. I had so little money that I kept convincing myself I'd be able to catch up next month. Unfortunately, I didn't. I've cut my expenses to the absolute minimum, even when it comes to food. In two days, I have no idea what I'm going to do, I won't even be able to charge my phone or cook a meal.

The worst part for me is that the internet is the only place where I can calm myself down. Every time my mind fills with negative emotions, a short visit to a random website or a video on youtube helps me process those feelings. Books used to help me in the past, now it's the internet. The thought that I won't be able to do that anymore honestly terrifies me. I hate that feeling when a small, dark thought pops into my head. The constant rumination and replaying of the past drives me crazy. It frustrates me because I know it's pointless, but I have no control over it. Instead of focusing on the present, I keep thinking about the past and the future. I want to finally get out of the hole I fell into years ago. I want to move forward, step by step.",1752154909.0,1,0
1lwcviw,Psychiatrist called me immature and petulant,"So yeah, my new psychiatrist shamed me for still living with my parents, said I need inpatient or else, didn’t change my medication at all. I don’t know what to do. She didn’t like my answer when she asked what’s holding me back from killing myself, I said the fall from the 14th floor would take too long. She said that usually people talk about their families but I can’t see beyond myself and that’s why I’m immature and need inpatient. She literally said my ASD and BPD shouldn’t be diagnosed until at least two years into psychological assessment and monitoring, but she called me a brat on the first appointment.

I don’t think about my family missing me because my dad is an alcoholic waste of natural resources, and my mother is a raging narcissist. That’s why I don’t give a flying fuck about them. I care about my dog and turtle but that’s really it. In her mind a bad relationship with them is entirely my fault because I don’t want to get getter. She said she didn’t like how I talked to my mother who I didn’t even want to bring into the appointment, but she asked her to come in to talk about inpatient. She said I talk to my mother like a petulant 16 year old.

I know I’m not doing well but fuck you lady. She literally said I can’t get better -ever- if I don’t do inpatient now. But I can’t pack up today and leave tomorrow, this is really fucking big.

we were comin back from a party and i was the one drivin. she asked if i was good, i said “yeah yeah i’m fine” even tho i’d had like 3 drinks n felt lightheaded af. but i was so sure, so damn cocky. i was like ""i got it lol chill"" and she just trusted me

i remember her laughin like 30 seconds before it happened. she was singing some stupid song off key like she always did. then outta NOWHERE... loud ass metal crash, glass everywhere, her screamin for half a second n then... nothing. just pin drop silence. I walked away bruises, cuts, broken wrist whatever. she didn’t walk away at all.
her mom hugged me at the funeral. said it wasn’t my fault. said she knew i loved her. i wanted to scream, throw up, run. bc idc what anyone says, it was my fault. every last second of it.

now it’s been months amd i still text her sometimes like she’s gonna reply. i keep her voice memos. i play them, just cry on the bathroom floor like some pathetic mess. everyone around me moved on. but i didn’t…i can’t. like how tf do u “move on” when u know u took someone’s entire future away i don’t want forgiveness. i don’t even want to be here most days. i just want her back. or for it to be me instead.

1lwaddx,20M I don't see a purpose of myself anymore.,"I'm basically giving Reddit my 2nd last hope of faith, please guys read carefully.

So my life has always been really shit and there is nothing better then to describe it, my mom and dad divorced since I was 3 and haven't grown up well.. We were poor and sometimes couldn't afford food for about 10 years that i was living with my dad, i did see my mom occasionally but not too often, i always had special education school's trying to teach me school stuff but i had severe anger issues since I was little (I have a heavy form of ADD/Autism) and which caused me to never finish any school I went to here which also means no middle degree diploma.

I tried to work when i turend 16 after all the drama i went through and tried to build a future, my first job was McDonald's and i got fired after 4 months for showing up 3 minutes before clock in time, these unfair fired situations went on from job to job and not even always the same reason, after 5 years of working I always got fired within 3 months because i could never get locked into my work, i feel useless being 20 with a girlfriend now living off of €300 a month (low expenses per month no rent) because I can't get nothing else then a small portion of government money

Also that i have had a relationship for almost 9 months now and got so say that this is the best I have ever felt in my life, after almost killing myself from my ex and feel horrible about the other 7 that treated me I couldn't even stand to think how she would feel if i ended my life maybe today or tomorrow... It's a healthy relationship and i feel like breaking up with her and then doing it should ease the pain a bit, but i would also think it wouldn't..

im just daily drowning in my thoughts at this point and have a little clothing reselling business that doesn't make alot, and i daily smoke weed so that i didn't kill myself 2 years ago, it's not even helping anymore at this point and im gonna probably kill myself in any day of this week, so that no one will also be bothered by that anymore, everyone thinks im disgusting for doing it so much but it's the only thing that makes me happy from besides my girlfriend at this point...

1lw9kv1,Am I harmful?,"My name is Timothy, I recently turned 18, I've been thinking about acting in an extreme way for some time now. I don't think I'm truly depressed, but I often feel bad inside. In elementary and middle school I was often bullied by my classmates, I would say because I have Asperger's, but perhaps they found me different for other reasons. It took me a long time to make friends that the other person also wanted to keep, even though I admit that often my current group of friends we don't always manage to hang out with, I'm very happy to have them. With friends from school it's very different, they're not bad people, but I think like those previous schools they find me strange, or at least don't like my company, and I often suspect that they're only with me so they don't dangle me or something. My parents aren't bad people at all, I know they would sell their souls for my happiness, but my mother always complains about what I do, about the mistakes I repeat, and I don't think I can blame her. My father is a somewhat harsh person, but he loves me with all his heart, but from my point of view he has never been able to really console me, he often raises his voice, and throws my faults in my face just as many times as he consoles me. My younger brother and I love each other, but he often laughs at me or accuses me of my autism, and tells him that it bothers him, he has told me things that I find horrible several times, and every time I try to defend myself he tells me that I take it too hard. In the past my brother helped me a lot. Besides, I can't put the blame on him at all, because I'm a first-class crybaby, and I even made my mother cry a while ago with my complaints, at least once. I'm sure my father also suffers a lot from my situation. My first crush was horrible, I was convinced she liked me, I declared myself excessively, she already had someone. I spent 2 years chasing her, asking her out, and kept doing it even when it was obvious she was making excuses not to go out with me. When she got together with another guy I was desperate, so much so that my obsession reached a level I didn't think I would reach. She begins to ignore me, probably already tired of almost two years of insistence. Some time later I asked her to reconnect, and to distance myself if my obsession manifested itself again. He said no. I also have a best friend, to whom I declared my feelings, rejected. Since she moved to the new school she talks to me less and less, now she doesn't even read my messages anymore, but I don't have the courage to give up on her because she means everything to me.

1lw9ei1,I'm Suffering in Life,"My partner and my parent, I feel stuck between the two of them. My partner's family is toxic and they were never happy about my being in my partner's life. They always wanted to separate us and went to worst extremes to do all that but remained pretentiously nice in front of my partner. My partner suddenly started to lean more towards them to the point of refusing to marry me. They always used my partner but faked to be caring which he never understood.

My parent, on the other hand, doesn't want me to visit him fearing I might not be safe. Whoever we come across adds fuel to the already burning fire by narrating terrifying stories and saying it's not safe.

I've never once visited my partner. He always has to come me whenever possible. I believe if both of are strong in this, one of us is able to travel and the is unable to then shouldn't let such things come in the way of our relationship. Now that my partner is unwell and is alone, he's been fighting with me that I should come see him at least but circumstances prevent me from doing it.

I'm stuck and feel suffocated. I already was compelled to cancel my wedding because of various reasons and now that we have a new date, I don't want anything to go wrong. I'm unable to deal with his emotional tantrums.

It's not that I don't want to go, it's the circumstance that's making everything difficult for me. I feel like ending it all. I'm dealing with a lot of things that are too much to handle but I'm proud of myself that I'm able to stay strong but I can't go on anymore.

I'm ruining my health too. I'm unable to eat, sleep but I'm doing a lot for my partner's wellbeing from here that I can't share with them because of his unstable mind.

our relationship was rough but at the end of the day she was still my sister and I miss her. we never made up things never got better between us and I feel so so guilty.

tomorrow we're going to the funeral home to say our goodbyes and I'm at a loss of what to say. does she know I love her? does she still think my parents hated her? did she suffer? Im so scared that she suffered and that she felt alone.

she was doing better she was clean she had to b for her baby and she just wanted to blow off some steam the investigators think but she didn't know it was too much and it killed her. I wish she knew how much I miss her. I wish I could tell her how much my heart has been aching. I threw up when I found out and I just can't seem to grasp the fact that she's really gone and I'm never going to see her again.

I broke up with my long term gf last year as I thought I’d be happier elsewhere. My expectations were not met, I regret my decision, and she’s engaged now.

I’ve tried to fill the void with meeting other women and hobbies, but each seems excessively empty/forced.

I met and briefly saw someone who I thought had great chemistry, got attached, and then she ghosted and is seeing someone else. I’ve been crushed by this.

I started Wellbutrin 2 weeks ago and haven’t felt anything positive, it might be provoking anxiety, but I’m not sure.

I’ve always been a sad and negative person, but the last 1-2 weeks has been mentally MISERABLE. I cannot focus on anything except overthinking about previous relationships and where I’ve gone wrong since, and what is wrong with me. I haven’t been able to sleep and my appetite has been wrecked.

I’ve been through this in the past, but at age 34 with limited dating options and chances of meeting someone slimming down, I feel hopeless. I don’t have any real friends and have a bad relationship with my family. I pass the time with extreme workouts (training for a full ironman currently), but each ‘event/race/marathon/etc’ only makes me feel worse about myself. It’s another means to a nonexistent end that won’t lead to fulfillment.

1lw82yk,Im a 16 year old thats going through hell. Please help.,"Hello I have some post about this on another subreddit that I don’t really remember the name of and don’t mind if my writing is bad as Im writing this out of sadness or whatever.
Im a 16 year old male that has three siblings, my sister is 12 years old and my younger brother is 6 and my other younger sister is only 3, ever since I was 12 years old my dad has been going through a drug addiction, I don’t know what drug specifically but I think it’s crack.
My mom must be undiagnosed bipolar as she always calls me stupid and retard and other really hurtful stuff like they are normal words.
Once my mom was yelling at me all because I couldn’t find her shoes to the point she said to me”if you don’t find those shoes soon I will come up there and fucking slap you”Im just tired of everything.
Well things seem to be getting slightly better, my dad is finally at that that rehabilitation program for his addiction and he’s supposed to be in there for a month, but he didn’t seem happy.
My mom hasn’t changed much though as she will still be happy and joking around one moment then she will be a mad at us the next minute.
Im also really bored and on my phone more as my pc is right now broken, my mom has to fix it soon.
So I really have nothing to do. I don’t even have my own tv as they pawned it for my dad’s addiction when he was still here. So I have to watch tv in the living room which is really annoying due to my sister also wanting different things on.
I don’t really have anything to say just bored without my pc as it’s broken but my mom is going to take a look at it and whenever she touches technology it magically works.
Also I have been dealing with sleep problems, like I can’t fall asleep even if I take melatonin or something thats supposed to help you sleep.
Im already talking with therapist.
But I never show my actual emotions as my mom will always just blame me for acting up to not do chores.
I just hide my real emotions with emotions that makes it look like I’m doing fine.
Kinda like putting on a mask so people don’t see what’s really going on.
I don’t scroll much on my phone, as my dad is at that treatment, I have to do the majority of the house work and my sister keeps leaving me alone to not only clean and watch my siblings alone while she goes to her friends house, she was gone for 2 days then now she left again even though she basically just got here and she didn’t even clean her mess before she left.
And I think I get why my sister always leaves, I would not want to be in here as much as possible too as I know that she also deals with what I go through with knowing about my dad’s addiction.
my mom is dealing with an ingrown toenail that she says hurts a lot even when she stands for a little bit but even before she had that ingrown she barely did anything but stay in her room and watch tv.
First of all I want to get one thing out of the way, my mom is not some villain as I think that’s what I have been making her sound like, she’s not some big scary villain and I think I know why she acts the way she does.
Both my parents grew up in not so great conditions as they both were in berens river reservation, they were both raised in not so great conditions but my dad went through a bit worse as he was surrounded by drunks and drugs, my dad had to skip dinners so his siblings can eat and he had to do heavy work when he was younger.
My mom also had to skip some dinners for her siblings but for some reason she was the one who immediately had to get a job and her mom straight up took most of her money.
I also get what my mom is going through, my dad has been to treatment multiple times already and he failed most of them, ever since I was 12 he would borrow money from people for his drugs without telling my mom and she would have to pay it, my dad acts like a big child like my mom is with a teenager instead of a 40 year old man.
My dad pawned stuff of anything valuable like electronics for his drugs, every time he got a lot of money, he would just give my mom a little bit then drug up the rest.
The entire time he never worked in a real job, he would just work a bit for a family member then keep most of the money for his drugs.
Once he got 1000$ from doing something for a friend that is in jail but he gave my mom like 180$ then he hid for a while drugging up the rest.
And whenever she tries to kick him out he would act like a poor sick guy so she would let him back in as she said she still loves him.
So I think the recent stress and her past is making her act the way she does.
in school i never showed my true emotions but I was always distant from my classmates so I never had a girlfriend or a real friend(just people that looking back now were probably just feeling sorry for me as I was the weird alone kid).
Sometimes I act like a funny guy that doesn’t have anything important going on.
I sometimes laugh along with jokes and make funny pictures with Canva.
But my adhd and depression and feeing like Im not good enough makes me not able to put in any real work into my school work and that’s why a failed and had to repeat 9th grade, whenever a teacher asked I would just say I have personal family issues that I don’t wanna talk about.

1lw7m46,Panic attack medication,"Hey,
Somewhere in march I had my first panic attack - it happened at around 3 am. I just woke up and seconds later I got a panic attack, I was so scared for my life because I didn’t know what was happening to me but fortunately my friend who was present at the same place at the time “reassured” me that it is a panic attack which somehow relaxed me even though it lasted about an hour.
I immediately decided to go to a psychiatrist but the earliest appointment was available for july 3rd this year so I waited. During this time I had some calming herb pills from the pharmacy that I took up until the visit. The first two weeks after the original attack were awful I was getting daily, less stronger panic attack throughout the day, I was scared to leave the house and go to sleep because I didn’t want to wake up to a panic attack. 2 weeks into May i finally started seeing improvement, I no longer feared to leave the house, even didn’t fear going to the shop or pharmacy and even was able to cycle and go for long walks. Managed to not have a panic attack since May first. The psychiatrist prescribed me venlafaxine 75mg that I am to up in dosage to 150mg in 2 days (5 days after starting taking 75mg) and then to 225mg after another 5 days. After the first day of taking the medicine my panic attacks returned, I had 3 on day 1, then I woke up at 2 am and felt heavy anxiety throughout the night, my chest was tight and I felt waves of cold hitting my body, I finally managed to fall asleep at 6 am. I contacted my psychiatrist and he prescribed me Xanax SR 1 mg for when the panic attacks happen but I haven’t taken it yet because I am scared that it will cause more panic attacks. I haven’t had a panic attack for 2 days but I still feel anxiety and uneasiness alongside medication side effects such as huge lack of appetite - I eat half a bread-roll in the morning to take the medication and then when i feel slightly better in the evening whatever leftovers from the dinner I get, my pupils are dialated causing me to see weirdly and I feel out of this reality as if I looked at my surroundings but didn’t comprehend it. I wake up so many times throughout the night. My psychiatrist told me that the increase in panic attacks and anxiety is not uncommon in the starting days of taking medication for fighting panic attacks in the long run but I would like to know if someone had/has something similar and if the awful side effects eventually subside/stop. Because of them I am once again scared of everything, even to leave the house so I have to relearn everything once again.",1752136691.0,1,3

1lw7c2u,Help me find the point for her,"My (46m) girlfriend (45f) hates herself and says she doesn't want to be here any more.

This will be a bit of a ramble.

Opportunities for jobs are poor in our town and without a job she has no money, which means we can't afford to do nice things. A lot of her jobs have gone to shit through no fault of hers eg workplace bullying, going bust. She still blames herself. Without nice things to look forward to she doesn't see the point of carrying on as then there is no point to the drudgery of a hospitality job. We've missed so many gigs we've bought tickets for over the years, trips never taken. I support us with my salary and we have a roof over it head and food in our bellies but these days it doesn't go much further.

Our dog is the love of our lives but he's getting very old and his health is deteriorating rapidly. When he goes we don't even know who we are as a couple any more and it feels like we're living in limbo with a train coming down the tracks. He kept her sane through lockdown, but he's powerless to help now. We can't take him on walks to get out into nature, as he can't walk far.

She says we've been broken by five years (been together 15) of close friends passing, sudden death, suicide (it's a horrible list which i won't go into) and it can be hard to argue some days that there's a point to it all, especially when you see the things people do to each other. Counselling has helped me recently have an outlet, but she won't go back, as she always has to dredge up the traumas of the past. Years of turning ever inward, of feeling lonely have cost her friendships and made her alone, she's estanged pretty much from both her parents and sees herself as a failure and a disappointment. I am close with my family and we've welcomed her in but she says they think she's not good enough and must be worried about me supporting her constantly. They've never expressed that to me and i don't believe it's the case.

I have told her i won't give up on her ever, i know i have been at fault sometimes for burying my head in my own grief but I'm determined not to this time. But she's so stubborn at taking support financial or otherwise.

I don't know what to do. I know I can't fix her but I want to help her. We're in our mid 40s, no kids.

Thanks for taking the time to read.

1lw7a7d,Waking up with extreme self-hatred,"Does anyone else experience this every morning after waking up? As soon as I wake up, I immediately think of all my past/previous wrong-doings, behaviours and mistakes that I wish I could take back, which leads me to what feels like the most extreme self-loathing and self-hatred to the point where I say to myself ""I wish I wasn't here""... Later in the day I'm a little better, but every morning it's always the same intense negative feeling that makes me dread the day ahead of me. My doctors have diagnosed me as OCD, which explains a lot of behaviours, but they also believe I've fallen into deep depression - even my own mother has openly said to me I've fallen real deep.

1lw752k,A small piece I wrote in a fit of existential dread,"Gruelling winds and a vestibule of black smoke were swirling in the air that night. A crimson red dot on the carbon print shone like a lantern. It glimmered and danced in the pitch black surrounding. It pulsated, grew an inch, shrank two inches. But it didn't waver, it knew it had to keep on else it too would dissipate under the strain of the long nigh. The days weren't all that better either and often it didn't know why it had to be lit at all. The light hurt and burned in the centre, it pulled itself inwards for as long as it could remember, and this endless forced motion caused its edges to vibrate and shake, which was ridiculous and tiring on its own. Why did I have to shine at all? With each day the light got harder to maintain. I had moons now, I was like Jupiter with two moons shining next to me, but their shine was resilient, it practically never wavered. I envied them. They were static little dots and I was a fragile and bubbling ball of throbbing fire. I had lost moons before. It was thrilling and liberating but also quite scary. Why should I glimmer if there's nothing to maintain with my kinetic energy? And did the suffocation of the previous dots fix my glow? No. At least I wasn't trying to make it seem like I am static anymore. More energy went into that than into actually keeping my light on. Now I am brittle, blistering, raw, overwhelming and ugly, but I am true to myself, or at least a bit more truthful than I was before my last collapse and rekindling. How many times have I collapsed? Perhaps 5, no - at least 10 throughout my existence. Not a full collapse but more of a reboot, each time rising back up messier. I knew that one day I would (I will) inevitably join the darkness, I will be the background and not the outlier. I will be nothing, in which the new dots and lights will drown. I wasn't always red, perhaps I was green in the beginning? I don't know. I remember being orange, brown, yellow even, on the good days. But I’ve been blood red for half my cosmic life now. This is all I know and all I’ll ever know. Will I become brown? A dark rusty brown sounds really nice right now. I don't know, all I know is I cannot force a colour change. The storms are heavy now. I unleashed my entropy, I am unstable, I am like an uncentered generator, spinning out of focus, out of balance, my flickering light is wavering and I am caught in the middle of the brutal winds. I don't like it, its like a million splinters that suffocate my entire being. I want an absence of wind. But will I still gleam so beautifully and so raw without the wind? I quite like my form, my unrulyness and uniqueness. If I was a spectator and not the storm itself I might've even found myself truly mesmerising. But its very uncomfortable being both the spectator and the essence. Am I wrong about my constitution? Am I truly beautiful or am I a victim of a false image based on vanity and ego? Hope not, otherwise the only good thing about my storm would vanish and I really would need to pull the plug as it were. To collapse onto myself and my moons, to explode in a blinding rage without knowing what will be born on the other side. Its a thrilling thought but there is no guarantee I will keep my form and colour. So far the explosions have only led to betterment but this surely can not and should not go on forever, there must be an optimum form for me. But what if there isn't? Well then both previous and hypothetical future metamorphoses will be in vain. Then it would be demanded of me to roll from one explosion to the next ab infinitum until I consume myself like a reddish black hole. No I refuse to grant that way of thought any more consideration. So there must've been a logic and a need for my cosmic evolution, but to what end? Toward what goal? Maybe I can't ever know, maybe I just have to experience it. Maybe it was never truly my decision to explode or not. Could this bear any truth? Then why was I so reluctant to change? Some people do it on a whim. Why have I battled tooth and nail against it? Each time I fight against it harder, it turns out inevitable though, at some point. Is the suffering only needed insofar as to feed the explosion itself, to fuel the new world? I am scared of not knowing but at the same time it's liberating. But it's still a grand struggle - unavoidable or not I still have to fight it, for it won't even take place if I don't! Such a paradox is the life of this star. What is written in stone and what is decided by me alone? I refuse to believe it's possible that I am fully responsible, while it is possible that I am entirely not responsible, but then again if I had to bet I’d say its something like 70% universal law that I could and should never grasp and 30% of my own struggling inner fire that somewhat decides on the details of my own motions and sprites. So be it - the fighting won't stop until I am fully absorbed by my own ghastly void, but that also is not up to me! Until then I will, willingly or not, go through the motions and live up to my mysterious fate whatever way I can! I will choose my battles though I can't abdicate from such things entirely, nor should I! I cannot meddle with the affairs of the carbon black plain I can only cast my crimson shadow upon it! For it is me who makes the blackness vivid and wild. Even though I am a mostly selfish star I do not exclude the possibility of other stars, moons and whatever other celestial bodies are out there actually needing me for their own metamorphoses. I won't hide my light I will just be extremely selective about where it gets spent, since I’ve come to understand I am a autophage of sorts ie I feed on my own lights, I am a self-powering entity but I will not absorb my full essence by myself as that's almost as stupid as gushing out my fire myself. I will shine, I will roll and dance and burn and bleed but I WILL SHINE. For as long as I am capable of it.",1752134712.0,1,1

Everything has just gotten progressively worse over the last couple of years and I don't even understand the point in my existence anymore. I've lost my love for living. I've struggled for so long. I'm tired. I just wanna feel something other than depression. Anything else. I got out of high-school about two years ago now. And my parents told me they would support me and help pay for my college. I busted my ass to get accepted into the college I wanted. I went from a 1.8 gpa to a 3.2 gpa in one year. I almost cryed when i got my acceptance letter. I began attending and they, did, nothing. I was supposed to move but they never supported me. I had to work 120+ hours a week at three separate jobs and drive back and forth to college. From austin to San antonio. 2.5 hours there and back 5 hours a day total, everyday, 5 days a week. I didn't know where I was sleeping every night. I hardly ate. I constantly had to fix my car. Even slept in it a few times. I ended up failing out because I could barely function in class. I found out my parents bought a second house with that money. I took a semester off to try and pay off the debt I had amassed. Come second year I got accepted into a lesser cheaper but still good college. They promised all the same as before and once again it all fell through. I've been to four colleges now and i dont even have the drive to learn anymore. they now have three homes and I haven't seen any support from them. My parents have been emotionally and at times physically abusive as long as I can remember. I picked up alcohol at 15, I was 2 years sober but I've relapsed ending every day with the bottle. My long term relationship with my loving girlfriend is fading away and I feel like I've just fallen out of love with her. Nothings the same as it was before and I just feel annoyed at her presence. I stopped having sex with her. And consider breaking up with her every night. I have no relationship with my parents and they don't with me. I feel like a tenant in my own house. I can't save money and don't make enough too. I have no guidance for life. I'm teaching my self how to be a man whilst comforting my mom through her failing marriage. I had to put my dog down this morning. He's been with me since I was 4. I've tried committing suicide multiple times but I can't bring myself to do it. I almost did 3 nights ago but my friend called me seconds before I wrapped my car around a lamp post.  I don't feel at home anywhere. I don't feel loved by anyone. I'm numb to all emotions at this point. I just don't know what to do anymore. I wish smoking or drinking would just take my life already.

1lw5awr,I just hate myself,"I just do. Everything about me sucks. It’s weird, because people compliment me. They’re being genuine, I think. Lots of compliments on my hair. “It’s so long!” I know. “How the heck do you take care of all that?” I don’t know. Not very well. Just the bare minimum of shampoo and conditioner, really. But having the long length just feels right. Especially after the attention it gets me.

My friend took a photo of my side profile when I wasn’t looking, and showed it to me. It was the ugliest photo I’d ever seen of a human being. And I’m not being factitious.

My long hair is the one thing people have consistently praised me for.

I’ve seen objectively uglier people. I still think they’re prettier than me. I do. Genuine smiles, aka happiness, are the most beautiful things in the world to me. I just, I just want everyone to be happy. Every good person to be happy. Every person who society deems unattractive based solely on looks, to be happy. It kills me to see all these humans who are better than me, suffering.

I hate my voice. I hate my height (too tall for a girl). I hate my attitude. The way I dress. The idiotic decisions I make. The depression I cling to like a lifeline, because I inhale a sharp breath when it makes me bleed, and I can’t begin to breathe without the pain. I’m stupid, like I said. Depression for me is often like having an alcoholic mother you can’t bear to let go of as she stabs shards of broken wine bottles into your back. (Except the alcoholic mom in question already left your annoying ass.)

I’m trying so hard. So hard to stay alive. To convince myself that it’s worth the pain. That the pain is worth experiencing even harsher pain, and worse yet pain after that. Because I can be happy some times.

I feel have wasted my entire life making wrong decisions at every turn from the time I was in high school. I opted to go into something I wasn't really interested in but since others were doing it, I did it. Then I never worked for it in and after college. I was so casual with life since I had food on my table and a roof over my head from my family's support. I didn't take anything seriously. I wasn't doing anything after college, was at home for a year. Then I took job for 10 months in a completely new field and left it. Got it only because it was at the office of someone we knew. Once again I wasn't doing anything for 1 year.
Then I started a candy business. I went for it because a relative had a been trading in this. Just did what he told me to, didn't use my brains. Started my brand. Wasted 4 months in designs because that's how long designer took to design one box somehow. Meanwhile I didn't do anything to promote my brand and business. Invested a lot of money I took on loan. On the first order it turned out I made a grave mistake in calculating cost of product. Turned out I could never earn with that cost. I never worked to make a sale. I was sitting at home looking for buyers online. I was only dependent on that relative. It shut down.

I wasted 4 years on this. 4 years where I didn't work. Just had a business to show to the world that I have something. Once again I stated a second business. Spent money researching, got an office in rent with parents money and idk what happened but as soon as I paid the rent of the office for 6 months, I felt lost and as if I am being forced to be in this thing.

I was in severe depression. Parents told me to let go and forget the money it's okay. So I did and I got back to being a little normal. And then I had to move back to where my parents lived (a different place, a small town) because I had no other option. While being away, the girl I was with cheated on me. I lost it. I was numb and blanked out for next 7-8 months. It took me 2 years to get out of it and be just normal and hold on. And I made a decision to get back to the city. I wasted 2 years in my hometown where I learner nothing. When I moved back, I thought I'd start something some business. It's been 2 years again and nothing clicks.

 I met someone here and after a long time I felt like I can love again. I felt like living again. But, I know my past and I had no earning. I couldn't tell her all of it, but I did tell her about my financial situation that i am new and trying to grow. Initially everything seemed good for the first month, then somehow it all started to turn bad. I was spending money on her which I didn't have. I fell in love and I couldn't tell her how bad I am doing financially. I was scared to lose her because I knew she deserved better. And that happened. She felt there's no future for us. She left me.

 Even when I am handling it better this time, I am once again extremely anxious. I feel sad all the time. I stalk her profile so much that it becomes unbearable and I am still unable to stop doing it.  I feel low. I worry about my work all the time idk what to do. I feel stuck and confused. I feel like I don't want to do anything at the same time I keep dreaming of doing something.

I keep living in the past thinking wishing I made different decisions. It hurts a lot.

1lw4osm,Advice,"Hello, everyone. I, 31F, have dealt with Depression since my teen years, which started when I learned that I had Autism. I've had Autism since I was a baby, but didn't know until my early teens. I've been to counseling, taken different medications, and done multiple things to get better, but then I started taking THC gummies, and I became addicted. I know I need to stop, and I'm going to try, but it's really hard.

So, on Monday, I accidentally left the gas stove on at my job. (I'm a caregiver). When my client's son got home, he noticed and became scared, which made me scared. (He used to be a first responder). Now, I apologized profusely and everything was fine. My dad called later on, informing me that the son would be talking to me about it the next day, wanting me to be mentally prepared. He also told me he would be talking to me about how I'm ""distracted"" by being on my phone constantly and bringing my Switch to play. I work Mon-Fri 8 hrs a day, and all I really do is clean and make sure my client has what she needs, as well as keep her health in check, and I spend most of the day sitting down, so of course I need something to do.

Well, my emotions got the better of me after that call with my Dad, and I ended up cutting myself. After that, I didn't sleep at all that night. Note, I also deal with insomnia. My dad comforted me during this, but then last night, I ended up crying again, and went to my parents' house for help. I spent the night there so they could keep an eye on me.

Part of me wants to go to a facility for help, but I have no health insurance, I wouldn't have any income bc this job is under the table, and my dad says it would be worse for me.

1lw4f66,I think hairloss meds gave me ED and i wanna end it,Im only 18 and have bad hairloss issues since i was 14 . Which is just so fucking unfair what did i do to deserve this. And a month ago i started using finasteride and two days ago i noticed slight difficult getting hard.  I know that’s a side effect but a very rare one. But of course it fucking happened to me. Literally starting college in 2 months and alrdy have no reason to continue living. This is so fucking unfair . The ed has a chance to never even go away so either my life is ruined that way. Or all my college and early 20s are ruined when i eventually have to go bald. What did i do to deserve this bullshit. I just want to kill myself at this point. I am so anxious that it wont go away if i stop the meds. But if i stop the meds i wont have my hairloss stop. What a fucked up dilemma. And im fucking 18 i literally had deep insecurities  about my hair when i was FIFTEEN. Guys should lose there hair when theyre 30 or 40 not fucking 15-16-17-18 .

1lw4edu,I feel nothing,"I’ve struggled with depression for 10+ years. Lately it’s gotten bad in a way it’s never been before. It’s gotten bad before. Really bad. Like having breakdowns every day, not eating, suicidal kind of bad, but even that was better than this.

The kind of bad it’s been lately had just been… tired… burnt out… numb. I developed PNES a few months ago. There were no major events in my life happening when it started. I just collapsed one day out of the blue and nobody was able to find anything wrong with me. Now it happens daily, usually multiple times in a day. I’ve lost any independence I had because it’s not safe for me to be alone as I might fall and hurt myself.

I’ve gotten suicidal again. I had a moment earlier today where I couldn’t take the pain and I started doing a brain dump, just writing every thought that came into my mind and it was all very suicidal stuff. I want to talk to someone about it but under no circumstances am I going back to the hospital. I’ve been 3 times and I’m not interested in going again. I wish I could talk to someone about this without the threat of being essentially imprisoned. I don’t think being isolated from everyone I care about would help me anyway.

After I had that episode, I just went numb. I want to feel something. Anything. I want to cry until I can’t breathe. I want to feel the hurt. I want it to consume me. But I can’t get myself to feel anything. This is worse, I think. Worse than being eaten alive by it. I don’t know how to come out of this. I don’t know how to make myself feel something.

I even went to my counselors office (basically like therapy) and she didn't notice and that makes everything worse because that shows me that genuinely nobody likes me because the signs were so obvious and they were screaming at people.

1lw3m1x,False hope,"About a week ago my mom suggested that I try out for a theatre company. I was a bit hesitant at first but went to the audition anyway. I really enjoyed the audition and a few days later they got back to us with an offer. I was over the moon when I found out I was put into Senior Chorus. Now, Senior chorus is the lowest level they offer. However, I thought they put me in Senior SHOW Chorus which is the second highest level. My mood improved SO much that whole day and I kept watching their social media platforms and re-reading the offer several times, fantasising a life on stage, performing, even making a friend or two. Today I woke up excited again, and I couldn't wait to perform with the other talents. My confidence went up a lot too, because I couldn't believe they put me in the second highest group just from one audition.

Unfortunately, today I re-read the offer once more, and quickly realised I was actually in the lowest level. The training level. I started crying because I was so upset. I don't know what I expected. But I realised I wasn't at the top anymore. It was false hope. I know I can still progress to higher levels, but it will take a very long time and I will be one of the older teens in the training level. So, I'll be with younger kids. I feel so bad that my parents payed for it, because I don't want to do it anymore. I'm so sad. I know I'm being dramatic and at least I have opportunities, but I've been in depression for almost half a year, anxiety, OCD, no friends, and this was the only thing that gave me slight hope.

1lw3a03,I don't know what I'm doing here,"The question has been lurking at the edges of my mind for the past few days. What am I doing here?

Of course, it's a general question which many of if may find ourselves pondering from time to time. But right now the question is in regards to my specific situation and location.

I'm doing some summer work in some far-flung part of the country. I wanted to get out of the city, yes. I was not happy there, yes. My girlfriend had just recently broken up with me, and then slowly distanced herself from me despite saying she wanted to remain as friends- I think I understand her decision, and it's valid, I guess, but, also, yes. I had moved out of my newer apartment which I absolutely hated, and then stayed the first few weeks of the summer break with my father, which I also hated, yes...

Ok, so, I wasn't happy where I was. That's fair. I needed money and didn't want to work in a restaurant while staying at my father's and waiting for the new semester to start. Ok. so I just hated where I was... Okay.

Well, so that's why I'm here, but the question remains: what am I doing here?

Am I here to make friends? get laid? make money? Honestly, none of those things appeal to me. I've seen more than enough faces come and go and said more than my fair share of goodbyes. I'm not interested in making friends for the short term and then going back home and probably never speaking to them again. I'm not interested in some summer fling either; if i get involved with a girl it's because I want something at least semi long term, or at least with the potential for being long term... If this answer to this question is simply 'to make some money"" then I may as well go jump in the river now and not come back out because that's fucking sad.

Whatever. I guess... I guess that I'll just follow the plan that I've set out for myself this summer. I've got a few short-term gigs lined up. The work isn't terrible. I'm in a pretty scenic place, and I'll have the opportunity to see a few new things.

I don't particularly like to say it, but I think I'm just not a good fit for the life that I was born into. Not a very good fit for the modern world in general. I mean, let's face it, we're all just a bunch of professional cock polishing slaves. Professional liars, actors, and manipulators. We're a scum species which preys primarily on its own kind. It makes me sick. Truthfully, there's a part of me that's glad that I don't thrive in this filth.

It would have been nice to have just been born into enough money that I could be aloof from all of the bullshit, but I guess there'll be enough time for being aloof in the afterlife.

That's one thing that I've always been willing to be certain of. I don't believe in any of the filthy man-made gods that fools worship, but I'm quite certain that there's something that comes next.

So, maybe that changes the answer a bit. What am I doing here? Am I here for a certain experience? What will I experience this summer? It's a large part of what has had me so miserable; what if I don't experience anything interesting here. Am I just wasting my time? Just making money over the summer isn't enough for me. I want new experiences. How do I get those... and what sort do I want... It may not matter what I want though- the perspective may be a bit buddhist, but I think that pain is one of the things which we need to open our awareness to... but good god, please let this NOT be an experience of hopelessness and futility in the search of feeling alive. Please let this not be a lesson in defeat and despair.

I've just never felt that there was much to see in this world. Not too many doors to open, and not many among them worth opening.

But maybe I'm wrong about that. I remember the first bit of live music I saw, it was an all female band in this basement in a random part of the city; they played jazz with a traditional Chinese influence; the vocalist was incredible, and the percussion... It was so much better than I ever could have expected. The experience was almost spiritual.

I was interested in music at a young age, and asked for lessons multiple times. but my parents- it's funny they were divorced and hated each other, but they were nearly the same person- neither of them gave a shit about letting their children pursue interests or develop skills. It seems pointless to start pursuing music at this age. but damn, I wish that I could makes music for a living... I wish I'd been able to learn from a young age, but as it is, I'm clueless. My parents really fucked all of us over- me and my siblings. Fuck them. Honestly. Staying with my dad for the first few weeks of summer was such a mistake. I hadn't spoken to anyone in my family much for a few years, and holy shit, things were so much better that way. Things only started to go south for me when I opened contact a tiny bit. I swear those assholes are cursed. Like something so toxic that just proximity is enough to make you sick- or the eye of Sauron maybe, once you have its attention you're just screwed, only way to live is to lie low and out of sight.

Anyway, time's up... What's my answer? I'm just here to experience whatever the world throws at me. I'll try to have some agency though and attempt to follow a path which is happier than it is miserable, I'll try not to let myself get too upset or discouraged by misfortunes. Things are the way they are... As one of my favourite strangers says: ""I can only change what I can change.""

Honestly though, I did my best, didn't I? It's not like I had the cards stacked in my favour. It was hard... it was all so painful. Now I'm just trying to figure out what the hell I'm doing, what I'm looking for. I don't know. Am I really just living? Playing out a story? I wish that... I don't know. I wish it could be different somehow. I still have a lot of years left of this... baring a random accident or an extreme, and (as things stand) unexpected rise in... in what... what could cause me to take my own life... I can't Imagine it. Ha... just remembering the descent trough pain. Yeah, I tried a few times then, but by now the wounds have scared over, and I'm a bit more numb to things like that than I was when I was greener. Those things don't drive me to want to escape as they did back then. What a... what a thing I have become. I can't say that I hate it though, you know. Ha. I remember that... and maybe I wasn't wrong... or was I... No... I don't think that that was ever taken from me. Maybe it never will be. Never can be.

Ehem, anyways. All I can do is continue to do my best.

Goodnight, folks. ",1752120284.0,2,0
1lw33r0,I’m 17 and a failure without school,"I’m 17 I’m now a senior in highschool but I take all my classes at a community college. Im intelligent I know I am not in a narcissistic I’m better then everyone way. I do well in school I like robotics a lot and am skilled in it besides coding. I like video games and started reading books for the first time. You hear this on paper and think I sound impressive I’m not.

I used to go out daily with friends during my first 2 years of hs but now I rarely hangout once a month. For junior year I left my old highschool because I was chosen in a program to go to a college full time instead of highschool. My social skills were always going down but it was still decent but when I got here I got worse at socializing. I’m autistic and have adhd not an excuse but I know alot of my behavior has to do with it I have depression as well so I’m sure that doesn’t help. I had one friend there at my college that I had majority of my classes with and hanged out with her and her other friends. So wasn’t that bad hated all my classes but it’s free college so I can’t complain. I felt lonely because the real friends I was close with I got kinda distant but I hung out with them occasionally and was fun in person. But I talked to them daily on the game but it’s not the same. Then next term I have classes with this friend again but not with her other friends. Sounds like I’ll be fine? It was worse she got a bf idc she has one that’s her life and I don’t blame her for my problems in the slightest. And half of our schedule was with him. I like the guy he’s cool and funny near the end of the term we talked more and more. But outside of class I’d be third wheeling and hated it and left at my soonest opportunity for the bus. So automatically had less socialization by nearly half because before I’d stay after school with my friends for an extra hour. Not too bad at least I left the house. Next term is the absolute worst. I took 2 online classes and one in person and one hybrid not a single one with the friend jsut because we needed diffrent credits. So I had to leave my house for classes twice a week for math and health science. I hated almost all of my classes at college even before none of them are fun except math to me. I did it because I needed the credits I liked the math class I had and the one before. My third term was the best math teacher I’ve ever had he’s fun and funny. But I didn’t make a single friend in all my classes. I was sitting at a table with people I didn’t know. Listened to the Lecture took notes leave. Rinse and repeat. Is it my bad? Of course while majority of the class were grown adults there were some students my age as well. But my social skills were so bad I couldn’t force myself to talk to them I got nervous and scared. I knew one guy and he came up to me a few times and it was highlight of my week. And at this time I hung out with my friends even less. I didn’t have to leave the house for majority of the week there were times I didn’t leave for a week because class was cancelled. I could count on one hand the amount of times I talked in my in person classes that term. Besides to the teacher and when it was another student it was very short “ can I borrow a pencil”. Is it my fault for not trying to talk to people make friends or anything yeah I just don’t know how to explain it. I want to talk so bad but I can’t think off what to say or not be awkward I don’t want to look like a creep either. I finished my year with mainly A’s which was good. But I never felt so alone during a school year till then. I don’t know why I’m like this. Besides my social skills my “professional” life is pathetic. I wanted a job to have a reason to leave the house so I applied. I applied to a sub way 2 McDonald’s dq Best Buy target Walmart. And I was rejected every single time. They said urgently hire help needed and I wasn’t even considered. I went to interviews and tried my best to smile and force myself to be enthusiastic about it. One interview told me I didn’t smile or seemed happy for this job. I tried my best and felt pathetic to be rejected by a fucking McDonald’s. I don’t know why besides my social skills I got rejected. My resume looks good at least I’d think so. I had to make a resume for a class and so we could use them in the future and I got an A on it. Had to use a format and needed to be checked and critiqued by the teacher. So I’d imagine it be somewhat better then most people making it on their own. I have a hard time in general showing  emotions I’ll be happy but won’t smile or I’ll hear something sad happen around me but I won’t cry. Now in summer I have no job and have hung out with my friends once. My brother broke his leg so we can’t leave the house much (not blaming him I’d still probably do the same as I did in summer but left my house a bit more). I hung out with my friends once and my summer is extra long by a month. I don’t start school till October. I have no gf don’t want to be incell and say I need one. “id be a good catch! Woman would be lucky to have me🤓👆” No it’s probably good I don’t have one. I haven’t genuinely liked a girl since my ex 2 years ago. I asked out girls been asked out trying to feel something and thinking maybe if I date them I could love them. Pos behavior I know I stopped doing it and realize how shitty it is. Girls have liked me but I felt nothing towards them. I thought I liked a few but I realize it was just limerence I enjoyed the chase the idea of not having them. But the second it got anywhere I stopped I realize I didn’t like anything about them and had to finally see who they really were. The robotics hobbies I had and 3d printing I haven’t done for months. During school I was busy at least that’s what I said but I realize I just don’t have the motivation. It makes me sad I have this hobby I can do but just too lazy to do it. Not a single aspect of my life is something to be proud of besides school and now I don’t have that to rely back on. Before I’d cope being called a loser saying I’m in college at highschool I’m doing fine. Without school I’m pathetic I have no job no gf I stay in my house and leave maybe 3 times a week. I’ve havent done anything and if I ask my friends to hang out they can’t and sometimes I physically can’t force myself to do it. Only way I can describe it is a social battery is so low jsut thinking of being around them sounds draining. I know alot of this is my fault and I’m sabotaging myself but i genuinely don’t know how to stop. I’ve tried therapy in the past for 2 years straight and hated doing it for personal reasons.

1lw1fb3,I always feel hated no matter what I do,"No matter what I do I always have the lingering feeling that I'm hated.

People treat me like I am a robot they tolerate and keep around for their purposes. All the time even when I was a kid and much more cheery and frequently smiled alot I was still given disdain. Nothing really changed I only got harsher-looking due to stress and all. Nothing is ever good enough as is... with others there's always something to be miffed about.

Even when I get in my one comfort zone, alone, away from people I am still given contempt. Alot of time my feelings vary from a ""I don't really care if they hate me"" outlook to a ""deep down I kind of care and it offends me a bit ""type. Sucks too because people are unavoidable. Plus I don't have any feasible means at the moment to get away and make a living. This feels like my life all day, every day on repeat. Go out, endure the hate, come back in only to deal with more.

A few months ago, I was messaging my therapist about how I was not feeling good and how I feel horrible about myself. Also how I wish I could go back to a happier time in my life. I talked about how I just feel like i'm not going to live a long life, and like it'll be short.

My therapist got concerned about that message, and asked me if I was safe.

I said yes... but I think about ""D"". How I could just escape from myself now and the life i'm living now. How maybe the ""Aflife"" is where I want to be since it may just be my life as a little kid again.

I said I was in a lot of turmoil and crying. I told my therapist that I felt trapped, that i've just been crying a lot this past week, watching sad stuff, listening to sad music. I even tried listening to music that used to make me happy, and I just cried. I expressed that nothing interests me anymore and that I can't hold attention onto things for too long anymore and I felt lost because of it. It was bad enough that in those messages, I said, ""Help"" in them.

I also contemplated going to the ""hos"" because of just feeling incredibly terrible. I let my therapist know that I was safe, though.

My therapist said that I could go to the ""hos"" even if I was safe. My therapist asked me if I could practice some of our coping skills... like coloring. I said no, because I had absolutely no energy for it.

When we met again, my therapist had me register for an intensive program that I am now attending.

The program is exhausting since I already struggle with feeling tired all the time, and I have to go to 3 hours of group therapy 3 days a week, and attend individual therapy for 1 hour twice a week. I'm trying to avoid the things that set off my episodes, I try to sit in a quiet place and color, and I feel like a mental patient with how intense this program is. Lately with all this intervention, I have been feeling numb / spacey / disassociated and feeling confused and unsure of things.

1lvzf12,34[M] father &amp; husband with nowhere left to turn,"I am going to try to keep this as brief as I can even though I am essentially laying out a good portion of the last 3 years of my life, some things that probably go beyond that even. But I feel I need to get all this off of my chest, talking to my therapist, AI, and sporadic pieces to friends is only getting me so far.

I'm the husband to a disabled wife, father to a 5yo, father-figure to a 9yo, and struggling through helping my SIL (mother to the 9yo). As to why I'm posting here specifically, I have treatment resistant depression and have been living with it for over 20 years. During those years, I have had maybe 2 or 3 that even remotely resemble normalcy - or at least not feeling the depths and numbness that I generally live with every day.

Generally, I just feel crushed. I have let people down and continue to fail it seems at every turn. My wife used to be a teacher, due to her disability getting worse she had to leave the specialty she initially was trained in to switch to one that is geared towards helping students who have disabilities similar to her own. In doing so she enrolled in graduate courses (after having literally just completed her master's in the specialty had been working in) and getting emergency certified so she could immediately start working with and helping that population. I did everything I could to support her - calling every day to schedule her paratransit rides from school to school (she was a district-wide employee), helping her with her classes, and helping as much as possible with our child, the house, and keeping up with my own work. This worked okay for a while, but where we were living at the time and with debt we had accumulated during the pandemic we just weren't making enough as a couple to get through. We had savings and I watched month after month as it kept going down. I was applying for better work and not getting any interviews, calls, or emails. I was doing everything I could to fix the income issue for about 18 months before we would ultimately end up moving - more on that to follow. I started spiraling more and more to the point I was calling and messaging hotlines to keep myself alive, and even then, it was very much a band aid on a gaping wound. I enrolled us into debt consolidation which cut our monthly downtrend in half, but it was still that - a downtrend. My depression was getting worse, and I told her I needed to move back to where she and I were from so we and especially I would have more support. She fought me so hard, begging me not to have her tell the district she was working for that she wouldn't be returning the following year. Then, the fire came. Our neighbors house who we shared a driveway with caught fire, and it spread to our apartment building. My family managed to make it out with just our PJ's, fortunately everyone else in both houses got out safely as well. This put me into survival mode - there was no room for depression, my wife and kid needed a roof over their heads. I tried to put what I felt I needed behind me, and I did the lion's share of apartment hunting while navigating renter's insurance, hotel stays, and next steps beyond a steady place to live. I found nothing. So, I got what I wanted, we moved back. I had a family member pass away just a few months prior and their children agreed to let me and my family live in/purchase the home. I found work, better than what I could have hoped for, but my wife couldn't find anything. Transit here is nothing like where we lived before, and this did cost her a fair amount of independence. Her resentment towards me especially during this transition was intense to say the least.

A little over a year into our living where we are now, one of my wife's sisters caught a felony charge for a mistake she made at work. I do not believe she did what she did maliciously, but letter of the law for what happened does not care about intent. She ended up taking in her child's father and one of her other sisters with serious health issues. It drove her mental health issues into a dangerous place. We also found out that the man had a warrant for his arrest. That very much goes against the rules of her probation. So, with her spiraling and living in a situation that could leave her child in a very precarious situation, my wife and I agreed to let my SIL, and her child move in with us. The understanding being that she would provide assistance to my wife with housework and pay a certain amount monthly to help with the increase of utilities by extra people being in the home. Additionally, her food assistance would be pooled in with the rest of the house's income for purchasing groceries so we wouldn't have to go through and label everything. We also assisted in other ways such as paying her bail when her grown daughter failed to do what she had promised, purchased new bedroom furniture so our children could share a room, and assist in giving her child the chance to participate in things like team sports.

There have definitely been hiccups. But, at this point I cannot tell you how many times my bank account has been overdrawn due to partial/no payment of rent. Both my SIL and my wife are on disability. My wife has since completed her second masters, but there's still a fair amount of work to be done before she is employable again - and that's before the complications of transportation once she gets to that point. I say that to say that I generate roughly 60-70% of the household after-tax income. Not even two days ago, my SIL was telling me how her finances are so bad that it is making her suicidal and that there's just no way that she can pay the cash part of her rent. I told her I understood and that I would help her refile for section-8, part-time job applications, whatever she needed help with to help get her out of the hole she's in and hopefully smooth out the issues of the household as a whole.

It wasn't even a couple of hours until SIL contacted my wife who is out of town on a trip talking like I basically kicked her out on the streets or would be very shortly. Also, today, despite telling me that she would not be helping financially with the home expenses beyond her food assistance, she asked me to ""lend"" her a fair amount of money to purchase a recliner for her room. It didn't help that just hours before she sent that I had gotten a withdrawal taken from my account that I had called to reschedule leaving me with negative $250 in my account. I went to move money from my wife's, and due to an issue at the hotel she is staying at, she had less than $50 in hers. That second part will be resolved in a week, but that does nothing to help in the meantime. When I told my SIL the state of things, I was just me with ""Ok, no worries"". No worries, the payment that came out was for my car, a car that my SIL has had exclusive use of since my wife started student teaching in February. I've had to borrow a car that was left to a family member from the same dead relative whose home I currently occupy. SIL does not pay the payment, the insurance, or the maintenance on the vehicle I am letting her use after her daughter's fiancé destroyed SIL's car last year.

I have given and given. I have tried to set fair boundaries for everyone in the house. I navigate emotional landmines and function as the voice of reason for every single person under this roof. I handle all of the bills, look at the monthly budget every week to make sure that money is placed into each account where it's needed based on how certain expenses fall. Counting commute, I work 50 hours a week. And yet I'm looked at largely like I don't do enough, like I need to fix everything. It's no secret in my home that my depression got to a point where I very nearly got fired from my job and have spent months regaining my boss' respect and trust. I nearly had to go on short-term disability for it, would have if it hadn't been denied even though I had a treatment plan, specialist recommendation, etc. to go with it my application. I try to do everything right, make sure everyone is comfortable, and yet I struggle with each and every problem, each and every expectation that isn't met falls on me. And, honestly, I don't know what to do anymore except to take a few minutes and write a wall of text to a bunch of random people on the internet in the hopes that the words are cathartic. Unfortunately, they aren't as much as I'd hope, but I set out to post this, and so I will. Hopefully this gave me more peace than I currently perceive.",1752108559.0,1,0

It gets harder and harder to even talk to the little remaining friends I have.

I’ve tried medication and it seems like it really was working up until a year ago. Out of all the meds I’ve tried, lexapro and Lamotrigine was working great but it just doesn’t work anymore for some reason. It hasn’t worked since January.

I constantly feel alone and my body is slowly breaking down on me. I’ve gained 60 pounds in the past two years because my body is in constant pain.

I have plantar fasciitis, I can’t afford the insoles. Im in pain everyday, no matter what shoes are recommended to me or exercises I do, the pain never stops. I have to crawl to the bathroom at night just to take a bath because my feet feels twisted and tied in knots. I’m sick of it.

I’m in crippling debt because the job I’m working for doesn’t pay much. I can’t leave the job I’m at because it’s paying for school. I’m stuck and it makes me feel like crawling out of my skin.

I came out to my family because I thought maybe it’d help me. It didn’t. They don’t get it. I wasn’t expecting them to, but my walls are slowly closing in on me and I don’t know what to do anymore.

I get angry at coworkers. I’ve lashed out and started being mean because of my own pain and I hate myself for it.

1lvyfa8,"i feel like i have tried everything, so how do i fix myself","It is really hard trying to be happy. I try really hard to stay positive and happy but it's all fake (trying to fake it till i make it). I am very grateful for life I always feel so deeply grateful for literally everything. When I start to feel bad about myself I remember the things that I am happy to have: a healthy, mobile, and active body, amazing opportunities, a good unfortunate life etc. etc. When it gets really bad I pour my heart into manifestation and words of affirmations. I really mean it when I say I have been trying, and I am unsure what else I can do to be okay. I often imagine my future to help keep a will to live but it hurts so bad I can't even find worth in my future, even though I know my future is very bright. I have always had very high expectations for myself and so I would often be disappointed in myself because I could not reach my impossible expectations (simply I need to be perfect but that is seemingly not achievable). I've been working on this mindset and allowing myself to be okay with not being perfect but I still get bad when things do not go well. For example, I did very bad on a quiz worth 6% of my grade today and it has triggered me really badly. Anytime I get upset I always immediately think about hurting or ending myself. I've been trying hard to fix this mindset as well, and honestly it has been working. Like when I look at myself in the mirror and hate what I see I remember that I am beautiful, and although I don't see it, those around me do. Or that I may not see it at that moment, but I know I am. I do see professionals and they have me on lamotrigine. I am very physically active and social (although I much prefer to be alone). I just feel like I am doing everything I can do to (at the very least) not want to die, but despite that I still want to. Whenever I am happy I always think ""wow, why would I ever want to die,"" so I feel like it hits me 100x harder because I forget how bad it hurts in the moment. I feel like a ticking time bomb because I can never remember the feeling of how happy I was just a bit ago, all I remember is how bad I am hurting and how badly I want to die. Sometimes I think I was put on this earth to kms. Nothing I do is ever good enough for myself even though I am really trying to be good enough for myself. I hate myself but I keep trying to convince myself I love myself. I honestly have no support system besides my therapist but I rarely see her at the moment (and even when I see her she doesn't help much). I am very tired of living like this, I just want to be okay.

1lvydli,I want to commit suicide,"

 I (23M) have been feeling this way since I was 15. As far as I can remember myself, I have been crying alone in a room for endless nights and days with no actual support. I have been depressed for 8 years now and I wish that was the only thing. I have been living for my whole life with my mom and my father almost always just created problems for us, whether it was not helping us financially or threatening my mom or me with some pretty serious stuff in which I won’t get into. My mom became abusive herself since I was young and remember her always judging me, telling me to die, or that I am not a part of the family. So my family in general is definitely something that ruined me the more they treated me like shit. Naturally, I was always trying to find a way out from that and that’s why I was always trying to make friends, only to see them making fun of me, avoiding me, isolating me, making plans without me and always dumping me even though I always made so much effort for them. When it comes to women the only thing I have ever done is give them my soul and heart only to see nothing in return. Stayed for so long in a shitty relationship because I always thought i couldn’t find anyone else to love me. Then I realized that she never loved me and never actually valued me. I did things for her that I am so ashamed to even say here and forgave things that I should have never forgotten. I am so broke financially and even though I would want to work, I am studying in a really demanding school so I don’t really have time to work. Well, that would be the case if I was performing well in school but I am not. I am complete failure. It’s so funny because I thought life couldn’t get any worse. I am academically unsuccessful, no social life, no romantic life, constantly expecting for everyone to treat me like shit and then they actually me treat me like shit even though every single time I try me best to keep them in my life, I feel ugly, my self esteem, confidence and worth have never felt more non-existent, I am constantly smoking and lately I started drinking too, I am ashamed to even walk through a crowd of people, now avoiding situations with a lot of people, I cannot meet new people or even form a proper discussion with anyone anymore and last but not least I have literally no support from my family. Well, I thought it couldn’t get worse. I was already waking up really late because I spend every single night crying or thinking of how much of an unwanted piece of shit I am. Well, I really thought life couldn’t get worse until it did. So I met this girl right before I broke up with my gf. We had all the same interests, we instantly clicked. Finally she had the same nerdy interests with me, she actually listened to me and this was right after I broke up. I finally felt like I was getting what I deserved for once and things were looking so bright ahead. We were the same in every single thing and she had everything that I wanted in a girl. Until she played me. She literally played me. She treated me worse than every girl has ever treated me and then literally blocked and left me to chase after her. And this I what i did. Slowly killed off the last bits of self esteem I had and chased her. This was the final straw. This feels like a prank. She came into my life without me even wanting to meet someone new. She seemed great. I fell in love. This is the last straw. I’ve had enough with everyone. Nobody believes but I will commit in the near future. I am truly done. I have been suffering for so long and I just want peace. I don’t want to be happy or sad for that matter, I just want to not exist. I am so done. This was my last ounce of hope and it was completely false. I felt so fucking angry because this didn’t need to happen. I didn’t need to meet her and I didn’t need to have this last ounce of hope. That could have been the end. I didn’t need to suffer more because it was already enough. But no it wasn’t. I was pranked and played with by my own life in the worst way possible when I was already at my worst. So no. At this point I can’t take it anymore. I have nothing. I have no worth and life just isn’t for me. I am done. This feels like my only option now.",1752105566.0,6,4
1lvydgt,i’m lowk so done,"my friends and i have been friends for 3 years. we’re all 14(F), and they were my ppl.

let’s call them kendra, mayzie, brianna, and isabella.

well, kendra, mayzie, and i have been friends the longest out of the five of us. especially me and mayzie. recently i got in a fight w kendra and brianna over a huge misunderstanding. i’ve been thru a lot of shit this year w my parents, family, school, mental health, js rly everything. i went to school w those four girls since 6th grade and i js got out of 8th grade. i moved two weeks into 8th grade bc i got taken away by cps.

my friends were very supportive and nice, but things js changed. i was struggling hard. i mean, anyone would be. my whole life was js turned upside down. kendra always seemed fake to me. she would get mad sooo easily and she js used to give me the vibe that she didn’t like me. she was never rly js straight mean, but w some ppl, u can js tell. that’s how she is.

none of us r popular. mayzie is an athlete and she’s friends w a lot of ppl, but she’s not a popular girl if yk what i mean.

kendra and brianna r band kids, and they’re not very popular.

isabella is a theatre kid along w mayzie and i.

i started to notice things were changing a couple months back. my friends r all rly into kpop and i used to be as well, but im not anymore bc there’s a lot of scandals in kpop and on top of that, the idols r treated like shit.

well, brianna and kendra got like MAD when i told them i didn’t want anything to do w it anymore. they lit got pissy and told me i was overreacting. i got mad bc y tf r u getting pressed over a music genre..? but that’s besides the point. the point is that the next day, they were talking bad abt me. so i cut them out and stopped being friends w kendra and brianna for a little bit. btw, kendra and mayzie had talked bad abt me in the past. i got over that tho bc ppl make mistakes and ppl change. guess kendra didn’t, huh?

so i didn’t talk to them for a couple days and then everything happened rly fast. i attempted and i got sent to the mental hospital.

well, it had been abt two months since i’d talked to kendra and brianna, but i decided that it was stupid to still be mad at them abt everything so i texted them both apologies. i feel like i shouldn’t have had to, tho. i mean, i wasn’t the one shit talking my bsfs. so we’ve been friends for a couple months now.

so i’m actually not supposed to be talking to brianna, kendra, mayzie, or isabella bc my dad said i needed a fresh start (i would tell yall what he means by that but that’s a whole diff story). well, im not gonna stop talking to my friends bc my dad wants me to. they’re my support system and they’ve been there for me when my dad hasn’t.

so i told my friends i was gonna try to convince my dad to let me talk to them so i didn’t have to sneak around and talk to them, and kendra goes “okay! but js so u know, i can’t invite u to my parties or anything bc im not supposed to be talking to u either.”

idk if im overreacting on this, but it lowk pmo so badly bc she has been a shit friend to me but IM the bad friend and her parents hate me. i always got the vibe her sister didn’t like me, and i didn’t think her parents did either, but that js confirmed my suspicion. btw, i used to have a HUGE crush on kendra and she lit gave me the worst mixed signals ever 💔 thankfully i got over her.

i’m not even gonna talk to my dad abt it bc i can’t even go to their parties anyways bc their parents won’t let them invite me over and they usually leave me out anyways.

like i started noticing that when someone would text in the gc, everyone would respond, but when i texted, no one said anything. it lowk hurts my feelings rly badly bc even tho im not the best friend, i try my absolute hardest bc i love these girls more than anything. they were lit my bsfs for three years. i js don’t get y im repeatedly made to be the bad guy by my parents and now by my friends too.

should i js not talk to them? are they even worth fighting for atp?",1752105555.0,1,0

1lvx3lg,"I'm emotionally dependent on my mother, but she plays a major role in my childhood anxieties.","

A little bit about my mother:
My mother didn't have a happy childhood [sexual abuse and more of i didnt know]. Her own mother was never interested in her and gave her up.
She exhibited very borderline-like behaviors back then, but I think it's more of a kind of emotional masochism, which my twin sister and I have too [it fits, at least].
I have a twin sister too and my mom took care of me and her all alone. I think it was just too much for her.

In my Childhood, my mother spanked me on my bare bottom when I was about 6/7 years old because I continued to wet the bed for a long time and generally even did everything in my pants.[probably because of anxiety]
Several times a week for over a year.

It was truly horrible. I often ran around the apartment crying and screaming, begging her not to hurt me, while she angrily chased after me.
Sometimes I tried to push the door to my room shut so she couldn't get in, and I continued to beg. The physical pain lasted a long time, and I never told anyone about it, and I don't know why.

At the time, I had undiagnosed ADHD and autism, and I had some issues that made me unpopular and lonely at school.
My teacher said my Mom should visit a psychologist with me, and we only did that once.
After that, she apparently just brushed it aside, and I had to continue going to school with these issues and perform the same as everyone else.

By the way, it wasn't even recommended that I start school at age 6.
I had a school entry test, which I still have, and it mentioned the issues, etc. And she still decided to put me in.

The worst thing, though, was that I was teased at school because of my gap in my teeth.
Here, too, it was simply ignored.
She knew, but I never received any advice or anything like that.
Because of an on/off relationship between her ex, we moved a lot.
The worst part was that because of the moves, I only attended most of the schools for about two to five months before we had to move again, and I had to keep changing schools because she was constantly arguing with her ex.
At each of these schools, I had the same problem with bullying and my neurodivergence.
[I transferred to five different schools in just under three years.]

There were times when she would just stare at her computer while I would cry in panic on my knees in front of her chair [I don't know the reason, but I still remember it].
I often laughed with my twin sister at the dinner table back then because the atmosphere always seemed so calm and serious, and we found that funny, but she would always get aggressive and start screaming.
It was scary; it sounded like she were about to physically attack us, and I remember being afraid of her when she got angry.

I still wanted her to take me to class when I was 12, even though the school was literally right next to our apartment. 2 minutes away. You could see the school from the window.

I'll be 24 soon, and I still can't imagine leaving her.

Everything she says against me seems so important.

When she's angry with me, I feel worthless and unloved, and I want to kill myself.

I still feel like the child I once was, longing for the attention my mother gave me, which was simply missing back then, or wasn't enough.


It's like I want to make up for everything, take what I've missed.

I love her and when i think back, i kinda hate her, but i dont want to. I feel awful.

Been in hospitals and institution for a very long time because I got epilepsy, had a pretty abusive father that only cared about authorithy and, overall, my parents totally neglected my basic emotional needs as a child.

Been doxxed, raped, had brutal psychosis episodes, got a bipolar diagnosis and always had people thar I considered as friends that let me down. They couldn't handle me past a point because was ""too much"" for them.

I also had a very long period of self isolation, trying to escape this hellhole. Now, I can't hide or cover my sufferings with this anymore, life just feels like a huge burden and I just want to end it all.

Maybe people that gave up on me are right. I feel useless and like a huge failure. Most of my days are made of nothing, I just watch anime and play video games all day long, just trying to forget that I am alone and that no one will reach me.

I tried to never give up and thought that things could get better. It happened sometimes but collapsed really fast. Now I just don't believe in this anymore and I don't believe that I'll be able to feel close to people either.

Then my she told me my mom told her to help me clean my room cuz and I quote “your sister is struggling with depression and anxiety”. Again my sister shut it down. I grew up with a mom who believed mental illness was demons and a dad who though mental illness was a joke. My parents are divorced, which didn’t contribute to my depression cuz I was glad they split up my dad is an abusive asshole and compared to him my moms a saint. But I’m glad they acknowledged it and see that I’m struggling but a part of me wants to tell them to fuck off cuz I wouldn’t be in this state if it wasn’t for them.

She knows me cleaning my room is a way for me to restart and if I don’t do it myself it’ll get worst.

Then i started lying to my family that i was passing classes because i was so much afraid of my father abadoning me as he did with my older sister when she was was 13 She had a black Boyfriend and they had sex and my father abandoned her.

My mum doesnt see how badly im struggling. the school reported me so she knows i sh, and through my councilling, she knows im suicidal (my dad also but yeah), but she acts as if im fine when i bring up potential anxiety. like REALLY? im pretty sure i had a LITERAL PANIC ATTACK INFRONT OF YOU. dont even get me started on depression. i feel like she thinks mh diagnosises dont matter but they DO!!!&lt;

1lvv8dg,I can’t do this anymore.,"I went to the hospital because I was jumping in front of cars trying to get hit.. and yk end it already but unfortunately people stopped everytime I got in front. one of them got superrr close like almost hit me by a cm but they stopped. All of this because I went to a dentist appointment with my mom. And spoiler I never went inside so they can check my teeth. But anyways I had to fill out this form and I didn’t really know what to put and I needed my mom’s help. And my mom had left already so I had nobody to help me. So I just walked out the dentist. And I still need these freaking teeth fixed.  But I don’t have a mom to help me! Literally wtf. Okay anyways so I got frustrated as a narcissist always makes you feel. And I started to you know try and end my life right there. So the people who saw me on the street called the police of course and I was in ally sitting on the floor crying because I’m still alive and I can’t go home. Well I didn’t want to. So the cops talked to me and I was basically telling them that they don’t even care and that it’s their job and I was having an anxiety attack atm so they were trying to calm me down. And idk why but they actually helped me for the first time. I guess this was ""serious"" today okay but anyways, they got an ambulance pull up a few minutes later and I’m like ""ur gonna take me to the mental hospital I already know!"" But they took me to a regular hospital so they can ask me questions I guess they know it wouldn’t end good if they did take me to the mental hospital. But okay while I’m the hospital room they gave me THE socks and the blue scrubs.. so I got scared of course and I refused to put it on. They said they needed my clothes? Like what? I been through this before so I know all their tricks that’s why I didn’t go inpatient. Their tricks didn’t work on me so they let me out. And I’m like 20 minutes away from my house and my mom left me stranded by the hospital. And the hospital staff was like making fun of me. I told them about my mom and the nurse said ""but she’s the one who pays the bills"" is she paying for ruining my mental health and brain? I don’t think so. So they all just triggered me because they all think my mom is a good mom. But she isint. And I hate this and I might go jump again I really don’t care . Oh and when I got home my mom told me I don’t have a mom anymore so there’s that. ",1752097316.0,3,0
1lvv4p4,"I live with a sealed mask on my face, and I’m afraid whatever I truly am has died inside it.","I’m not really sure why I’m writing this. Maybe because I’ve never said it out loud. Maybe because I don’t talk about any of this with anyone.
Or maybe I just want to feel like someone, somewhere, might understand.

My mental state is… unstable. It’s not a breakdown. It’s not one single traumatic event. It’s more like a constant background noise of emotional shifts. Sometimes I’m fine, sometimes I feel deeply low, disconnected from reality, emotionally needy, in love, in despair, or completely numb. I don’t know how to define it. I just know it changes all the time.

There aren’t always clear triggers. Sometimes it hits after a nice moment. Sometimes when I’m alone. Sometimes for no reason at all. And when it happens, I withdraw, or I pretend nothing’s wrong. Especially around my family.
They have no idea. I’ve never talked about any of this with them.

My friends have told me I could talk to them, but I can’t bring myself to.
Except for one person.
One close female friend, the only female friend I’ve had in the past 10 years. She knows about 20% of what I carry inside.

And honestly, I think I love her. Or maybe I’m emotionally dependent on her. I don’t even know anymore. But I feel good around her. Safe. Present. Like myself, if that version of “myself” still exists somewhere under the layers. We spend a lot of time together. Just the two of us. We go to restaurants, we cook together, I go over to her place often, we talk until late at night at her place, I walk her home or bring her back after school. We do all the little things that almost feel like dates, but they’re not. There’s never been anything romantic between us, not officially. She’s beautiful. She’s kind. And she makes me feel seen. I love taking care of her.

But I’ll never tell her how I feel. I’m too afraid.
Too afraid she’d take it the wrong way. That I’d lose the only person I feel truly accepted by.

And that fear is rooted in something deeper. I don’t even know who I really am.
I’ve been wearing a mask for as long as I can remember.
Not out of malice or deceit, just survival. Over time, the mask sealed itself shut. And I genuinely wonder if whatever I once was… is still alive underneath.

I live alone, because of school. I often feel bored, stuck in my own mind, thinking way too much. It’s like I’m wasting my best years, watching others live them.
And yet, I’m good at what I do. I’m successful in my studies. My grades are excellent. I’m respected by my teachers. I’m part of one of the best project groups. Objectively, I’m among the top students in my field.

But it’s never enough.
Because I feel like I have to earn my worth. Earn love. Earn a place in the world. Earn the right to be seen.
Failure terrifies me. Especially failure in front of the people who hurt me in high school. The thought of not being top of the class, of disappointing the professors who believe in me… it eats away at me.

At the same time, I’m incredibly harsh with myself.
My inner voice is cruel. I constantly tell myself that I’ll be alone forever. That I’m not attractive. That no one could ever accept me. That I don’t fit what society expects a man to be (even though that whole concept makes me uncomfortable). I feel like I talk too much about myself. That I’m not enough, or I’m too much.
It’s exhausting.

I have cried, a lot. And crying never helps. It just makes it worse. I’ve never screamed. Not once in my life. I keep everything inside.

And yes, I’ve had dark thoughts. I’ve thought about disappearing. Not dying, I wouldn’t do that. I’m Protestant, and my faith shapes how I view death. Only God decides when someone dies. Plus, I know it would destroy my family. Even if they have no idea what I’m going through, I know they care.

My relationship with faith is complicated right now. I still go to church every Sunday, but I feel far from God. Like I’m crossing a spiritual desert. And that distance makes me feel guilty.
Like I’ve failed there too.

I often dream of a different version of me.
Someone surrounded by love. With a partner, maybe a child or two, a house, a dog, a dream job.
I see myself as the head of a game studio, working for passion, not survival. Independent. Successful. Fulfilled.
But in that vision, I’m still alone.

I feel things deeply.
Sometimes I think I give too much. I care too much. I trust too easily. I rarely ask for anything in return. And when I do try to set boundaries, I feel guilty. Like I don’t deserve to take space.
I forgive easily too. Especially because of my faith.
I don’t hold anger against others.
I hold it against myself.

There’s a moment I think about often: when all my friends switched schools in 9th grade. I had to start over. I joined groups that were already formed, where I was never really part of them. I was always the outsider. Always trying to fit in without being truly welcomed. That feeling never left me.

I’ve always had to play a part.
I don’t even know what it would feel like to be fully myself, unfiltered. I don’t know who that is.
I’ve been wearing this mask for so long, I truly believe the real me might be gone.

But I’m still here.
I still have projects. Dreams. Ambitions. Especially about building that game studio. That part of me is strong. Alive.
But everything else around it feels like a long, painful journey.

And I carry it all alone.

I’ve never written any of this before. I’ve never even said it out loud.
I’m not asking for help. Or advice. Or pity.
I just wanted to speak. To exist in someone’s mind, even for a minute.
To show anyone what’s under this mask.


---------------------------------------

TL;DR:
My mental state is unstable and exhausting. I live with a sealed mask I put on long ago, and I’m scared that whatever I truly was is gone beneath it. I succeed academically, but I feel deeply alone. I’m in love with a close friend who doesn’t know how much she means to me. I have dreams, especially about creating my own game studio, but emotionally, I’m fading. This is the first time I’ve ever said any of this out loud.",1752097066.0,5,1

My own best effort could never yield me those results. Every attempt only met with more pain, misery and grief of continued failure and dissapointment at every turn.

My ego says I should blame luck. Fate. God. Other people. Circumstances. Not trying hard enough etc. But thats all a lie. I know deep down I can change the country, people, cirucmstances, environemnt and the results will be the same. That's the basic truth that stands. Ultimately, the issue is me and who I am deep down at a fundamental level. It's in the bones. Its in every fiber and soul of my being. Its a half empty bottle. A car with no gas. A solider with no weapon. I simply don't have what is needed inside of me and no best effort I do will change it.

The real brutal truth is that at the end of the day. I am simply not enough.

1lvu1pe,16 and i already want to die.,"It is so easy, yet so difficult.

I am a 16 year old boy. think i just wanna try to explain everything going on with me.
As a child, I was abused by my older brother, not sexually, but physically, would beat me up, hurt me, yell at me, and just scared me so bad. Whenever i tried to tell my parents. He would say that if I snitched, he would hurt me.
While all that was happening.
I was being abused by my teachers at school aswell. They would hit me, say rude things. And it was so difficult. I even had red marks on my back, i showed them to my mother. She dismissed it.

At the age of 8-9. I was sexually assaulted by my uncle, he is only 5 years older, and he is my mothers youngest brother.
He made me touch him, and he did things to my body. Twice. And both of them in the bed next to where my family was asleep. I couldn't tell anyone. He said that he would tell everyone that I did it. And that I was the bad person here. And i believed that it was my fault too and that i shouldn't tell anyone else.

Lockdown.

Sitting at home, not talking to anyone. And becoming so socially anxious and scared of just even going out. Feeling like everyone is only watching and judging me.

There was an instance where I went out to her something my mother had asked me for. I stood outside the store for an hour until it was finally empty to go inside. I was 14.

I am introverted. Nobody cares that I am introverted, i have no privacy, not wanting to go out is somehow feminine in my families mind.

I feel scared to even tell them about anything. I am terrified of my older brother still.

We have moves homes three times in the past 4 years. And i just feel so weird.

And I can't believe just now lonely i feel, i always was alone, but never truly felt loneliness. Now? I do, and it's too much. I have been feeling so depressed and suicidal for 3 years. But I can't. I tried self harm. It felt..nice. but it's not easy to do it discreetly when everyone is always around and you have no time for yourself, no privacy.

I right now, live in an apartment in the 48th floor. And there is literally a ledge right out of the window without any railing. I could jump out whenever I wanted. And I'm scared that I will, but I am also excited that maybe finally I'll have toe courage to kill myself.

And unlucky for myself, i can't help but hide my feelings, even when I want to tell someone. I just can't. I start acting all okay as if I was. But I know I'm not.

I don't know what to do. Talking to a professional? Impossible. My sister has depression 2 years ago, behind her back, my mother, father, brother made fun of the way she acted during the time she was on medication.
She is fine now luckily. At least they helped her. I'm a boy, and 16. I'm too young to have depression and I'm a boy, i should suck it up.

If I went on single instances. I think i would just end up writing a book about my problems. Because everything is my problem now. And everything makes me angry.

I'm not trying to be edgy or emo. I wish it was just an act and that I was actually ok.

It was our plan for more than a year, but last week he told me he's not going.
His first reason was that he didn't have any money, we talked about it and I informed him that I'd help him get on his feet, but he declined. It turned out (he rarely talks about it) he's not able to get a job himself due to his worsening mental condition and physical disability. I talked to my parents and they said they'd be willing to pay for us both for a while if he enrolls as well (it's free in my country do it's not na issue financially), but even at a slight mention of that he starts panicking and I don't know what to do.
He said jest not going anywhere, not even just moving out, because he doesn't want me to pay for everything, but I know if he stays in that house he's not gonna be around for much longer.

It all came up so suddenly and I don't know what to do. I can't really talk to him because he just goes nonverbal and there isn't much time to be patient and gentle either because we were supposed to be moving out next month. I only know I can't let him stay here. Any advice?

1lvt01e,My Life is a complete mess,"Hello, that’s my first time writing and speaking about my toughts in a post, it’s like I just need to say to someone how I finished in this shitty situation that’s making me become depressed.

So, here it comes.
I’m a 22 years old European guy, bald (I started balding 2 years ago when I was 20), short (5'6') and in debt for like 50k.

Let’s start with the first thing i’ve mentioned: baldness.

Baldness started as I said around 20yo, I’ve always had a full head of curly, black and nice hair, I was like in my prime when I was around that age, atleast, before i started balding.

My life was doing really good, I still was in college, I used to go out with so many girls and used to have fun with my friends aswell, I was in a good physique form and I was so happy about my situation.
One day, I was hanging around with a friend of mine and he started noticing some “holes” on my temples, I initally took it like a joke and had a laugh over it, so I forgot about what he said and went on.

When I came back home tho, I went to see if my hair were good but i couldn’t say I could see differences, and because of that, I just said to myself “nahh it’s impossible”.
Well, 2 years later, i’m here.
I lost so much confidence, started eating junk food, stayed so much time at home alone instead of going out, I used to play videogames everyday all the day and I didn’t want to do anything, I just woke up, ate, play, smoke and sleep.

I lost so much hair on my temples zone, I decided to go bald and even if i’m more confident about myself I feel like i’m not as good as I was back in the days.
That leaded me to a really mental sad state, as I said i’ve spent so much time alone in the last months that I lost contact with the real world.

But, some months ago I started working and it really started to change my mindset.

I was forced to speak to multiple people per day, all of them of different ages and backgrounds, it helped me to open my eyes.
I started focussing more on work and my life choices and I’ve almost quit gaming.

That’s a good thing, I don’t really play anymore like before, I started going to the sea and everything became good.. right?

Nope.

Today I met 2 of fecale friends that I didn’t see in a long time, and when they saw my new “haircut” they were kinda suprised and shocked about it.
I can’t accept it, I can’t accept the fact that I was so attached to my hair that all of my confidence was in there.. I don’t have a good physique, i’m short and now.. i’m also bald.

I can surely work on my phisique yeah.. but i smoke so much that i’m scared of training, i didn’t train for so long that i’m scared of having no breathe or power to do it.

I just don’t know what’s wrong in me.
Maybe I should just accept my new self and try to improve what I can improve.. it’s so easy to say right?

That was if for the baldness.

Now we talk about business.
I’m gonna keep it simple.

I decided to open an agency with my father, in which, I was the holder.
Let’s be honest, my father is addicted to alcohol and he drinks so often.
He also almost died two times when he was drunk, in front of me.

I also want to mention that my mum went away cause she couldn’t stay with my father, she’s not close to me so I see her like once a year.

Returning to my Dad, he left me in debt with the agency for atleast 50k.
I have literally NO MONEY to pay it.
He also has no money, he always say that he’s gonna pay for my debts but he’s just not doing it really, he just drink everytime he’s not at work.
I’m sick of this shitty life I have.
I didn’t even graduate in high school, i’m actually back to finish it in 2 years.

I’m hope to have my degree on summer 2027 if it everything goes well.

I don’t know where to get the money, how to gain confidence about my physique and my baldness and what to do to get back to the game.

I still have the desire to play videogames..
but i’m not doing it.

I probably need a therapist to figure out how to solve my problems.
Thanks for joining my world and reading my words, I didn’t even read it again, it’s a one take so it’s going to be more confusing than ever haha.

See ya.

2025 has made my depression the worst it’s been in a long time. The constant chaos of the political world, the fear of losing a job and not being able to find one, and the sadness of what is happening around me is making it impossible to get out of this.

I know I’m not alone rationally, but you feel so alone in the moment, that’s the “beauty” of depression.

I really want to be able to connect with others who may feel the same way, but don’t know how.  The lack of purpose and control I am feeling is overwhelming, and am hoping this post will make just one person who is going through this feel less alone.

To be clear, I’m on antidepressants and have increased the dosage and do not have suicidal thoughts or tendencies- just a general lack of motivation, constant fatigue, and a feeling of doom and gloom.

Like I will never meet the standard to live. I quit my job because I couldn’t stand being so insecure but it’s me. I’m the one making myself feel that way and I can’t stop it. I didn’t even hate my job and I was good at it but every time I was there I’d spend the next 10 hours berating myself on all I could be. All I could’ve done. All I’ll never achieve.

She said it's fine but deep down, I think it bothers her. Which is why I still pay for things like toilet paper, toothpaste, dish soap, paper towels, etc., with whatever money I can scrounge up. I bought a rice cooker for $70 because our old one broke, but no one was excited. They don't give a fuck, they don't find it impressive that I manage to spend $30+ dollars every week on essentials despite not working. It's not enough to my family, and I don't think it's enough for anyone on the internet either.

All of these memes and jokes keep popping back in my head, the ones about ""living rent free"", having no job, and being a ""freeloader"". About how my generation is lazy and ""doesn't want to work"". I can't help but feel like they're all laughing at me. No matter how many dishes I do, loads of laundry I clean, or packages of toilet paper I buy, I still feel like a freeloader. Rationally, I know that's not true and I think most people would agree that what I'm doing is okay for a teenager, but that doesn't satisfy me either. If no one thinks I'm sub-human and a leach despite not working, then what's the point of getting a job? I don't need to work to live and immense guilt is the only thing that drives me.

I told myself if I don't get a job by early 2026, I'm going to ""off"" myself. But I don't see the point if no one cares and if I feel nothing. Getting a job won't make me happy, that part is obvious to me now. No one is happy. Everyone is absolutely miserable and I don't know how to fix it. So what's the point?

What's the point of getting a job if money won't fill the emptiness? What's the point of going to college if the debt will cripple me? What's the point of having friends if they'll just cause drama and talk shit behind my back? What's the point of getting a girlfriend if it could risk getting married, getting her pregnant, and having a kid, only for that kid to end up as miserable and empty as me?

I tried finding religion. I consider converting to Judaism, Catholicism, Mormonism, the Islamic faith, the Baha'i faith, Spiritualism, etc. One way or another, my stupid Agnostic brain keeps bringing me down. It's not enough to believe that Jesus was a real person when I don't know which denomination is true. None of them can agree, so how tf am I supposed to choose? How can I confidently claim that there's an afterlife or not, or that Joseph Smith was a liar, or that Jesus is not God, or that hell exists and people who don't believe what I do are going there? And that it's okay somehow? Am I to believe that a perfect tri-omni being would create something so imperfect, so corrupted, so much lesser than itself, that it has to be damned and tortured for all of eternity?

1lvox62,Long term depression turned into apathy,"Tw for suicide talk

I don't know why I'm doing anything at this point. Everything in life is just mechanical motions I have to go through to fill the passing time, whether it's university, internships, hobbies or relationships. I feel like a skin walker lol. I've spent so much of my time cheering up my friends and making them continue living. I have two close best friends who have been suicidal at some point and I love them so much and I see their worth in this planet. It would break me if they actually did anything to themselves. I also have a partner and a sister who I don't want to burden further but sometimes I think that my disappearing would be easier on all the issues that rose between us instead of trying to work things out for another years after already passed years of trying. It seems awful but I feel like my parents are so emotionally unattached they wouldn't really understand what happened if I died, so I'm not really worried about them.

Right now my motivation is to keep living until some inheritance settlements are finished, since I want to write a will that will resolve some issues for my family that would arise if I died earlier. To be fair, I don't think I can do it because I still can't get over the hypocrisy of spending all of my teenage years and early 20s in keeping company to my two friends so they could live on without hurting themselves. I know it would destroy them, at least I like to think I'm important enough for them to feel that. Still, I'm so tortured by these thoughts that I don't want to talk to anyone about it. I feel like a lot of my friends are depressed and my yapping doesn't help them, that's why I came to here. I've started cleaning out my files and personal belongings just in case. I am still hopeful that I'll learn to feel better and accept that this is just the way life goes, but I keep overthinking.

1lvmp79,"Unsicherheit bei der Arbeit, Anpassung, Zurückhaltung Maske","Hallo zusammen,
möchte etwas Persönliches teilen, das mich schon lange beschäftigt – vielleicht kennt das jemand oder hat Ähnliches erlebt.

Ich arbeite seit über 5 Jahren in meinem aktuellen Job. Von außen betrachtet ist alles in Ordnung: ein sicherer Arbeitsplatz, geregelte Abläufe, eigentlich nette Kolleginnen in meiner Freizeit (wenige aber dafür Gute) und stabiles Familienumfeld. Aber innerlich habe ich oft das Gefühl, dass ich bei meiner Arbeit nicht ich selbst bin. Es ist, als würde ich eine Maske tragen – angepasst, ruhig, professionell. Aber nicht authentisch.

Ich nehme seit etwa einem Jahr Antidepressiva (Escitalopram/Mirtazapin), was mir sehr geholfen hat, meine innere Unruhe zu reduzieren. Ich fühle mich insgesamt stabiler – aber ich traue mich immer noch nicht, aktiv auf andere zuzugehen. Ich halte mich zurück, obwohl ich innerlich gerne offener wäre.

Ich denke oft, dass andere über mich schlecht denken oder sich über mich lustig machen könnten – besonders wenn im Großraumbüro gelacht oder getuschelt wird. Ich weiß, dass das oft irrational ist, aber das Gefühl ist trotzdem da und verstärkt meine Unsicherheit.

Was mich zusätzlich beschäftigt:
In meiner Freizeit bin ich eigentlich anders – zwar eher introvertiert, aber ich kann mich bei vertrauten Menschen relativ gut öffnen.
Und auch bei der Arbeit gibt es eine Kollegin, mit der ich mich gut öffnen konnte und bei der ich mich recht wohlfühle. Sie arbeitet immer noch dort – aber bei allen anderen Arbeitskolleginnen klappt das nicht. Ich fühle mich distanziert, blockiert, vorsichtig. Das Großraumbüro macht es für mich irgendwie noch schwieriger, weil man ständig beobachtet werden könnte.

Ich frage mich:
- Wie kann man wieder mehr bei sich selbst ankommen – und sich nicht ständig hinterfragen?
- Wie schafft man es, aus dieser sozialen Zurückhaltung herauszukommen – besonders im Job?
- Gibt es Strategien, um authentischer zu wirken und sich trotzdem geschützt zu fühlen?

Ich würde mich sehr über Gedanken, Tipps oder Erfahrungen freuen – vielleicht hilft es mir, einen neuen Blick auf meine Situation zu bekommen.
Danke fürs Lesen 🙏

1lvmddb,I was mistaken about how to deal with things from my past.,"Confessions like these usually begin with a single event, but I don't know if doing that will show the full picture of my situation. So I'll start from the beginning.

My (22M) father (???M) was never fully present in my life, he left my mom when I was too young to remember him being there for me, and relatives from my mother's side often said he was too careless, irresponsible, and dishonest - to the point of scamming my grandfather off of a large sum of money. To me, that meant I never developed a true fatherly figure from that early age, and so I didn't see him as my dad, but more like a someone who I felt biologically anchored to. I often felt shame for being related to him, but I don't recall ever crying or being angry for this.

Now, some would live through this and develop a stronger connection to their mother, but in my case, I never felt truly attached to her either. My mom (48F) has BPD, anger management issues and is a very overprotective/anxious person who tries to oversee my important decisions but can't stop berating me or comparing me to my father whenever she loses her temper. This has lead to some truly horrible confrontations, and sometimes whenever I can't deal with her, I just leave the house and spend days out living in a hotel. And to be honest, I don't know if I can find the words to express how lonely of an existence this has been, I feel emotionally charged all the time, I constantly live on the edge and try to mask it off by being calm and serene, but this only serves to feel even more isolated.

Talking to my mom about this only leads to momentary peace between us, but I feel so foreign to my own feelings sometimes that I can't even handle a hug from her, and I genuinely feel like I recoil or have a bad feeling in my gut towards anything she says that she loves me, I feel guilty because I don't know if I love her back.

To add to this, my love life is very messy. After breaking up with a long-term girlfriend, I just dated or went out casually with several people (sometimes even at the same time) but never went the extra mile to get things serious with anyone. I felt very lonely and seeked the validation of others through apps and affection, but as intoxicating as it was, it didn't fill anything in me. In the end, I lost my job, my cat died, I started alternating between medications like Lexapro, Luvox, Eszopiclone, and I started to feel like I was genuinely losing my mind, I barely had the energy to wake up in the morning. With my cat gone and my mother basically pressuring me to excel in college I couldn't find the trust to confide this pain to anyone, and as a result I secretly dropped out of my major, but didn't tell my mother about it even though she was paying for it - I lived with this guilt for a year.

Towards the end of that messy year, I started ""dating"" someone, an incredibly beautiful, smart and introverted girl who I had met in the past but reconnected with through a friend - During those months I grew very attached to her, we called each other every night, we got this habit of telling each other anything and everything we did - It felt like a new beginning for me, a sweet daily treasure that gave me purpose and meaning. But long-story short, this ""situationship"" ended in a bad note. I had a bad discussion with my father during my birthday and I just shut down, so I ghosted this girl, a regret that I carry with me through all this time.

I came back to her and tried to make amends, but the damage was already too deep for us to continue together. When this happened I felt absolutely deconstructed as a person, I felt worthless, I cried to sleep almost every night for what felt like weeks, while mourning for months, and remembering every small thing that we had in common. The insurmountable pain of this breakup was so severe that I couldn't carry on the guilt of having dropped out in secret, so I just confessed to my mother, but to be honest I never shaked off the feeling of loss for either thing.

I don't know if I was just infatuated or in love, but I can only say it was stronger than anything my heart had ever handled, and as a consequence, every slight reminder of her existence gave me an irresistible gut feeling that got me nauseous. Every cat photo, every happy couple, every song we shared, everything reminded me that I lost a great person.

Cutting back to today, we have drifted apart a year and a half ago, but I can't stop thinking about her. She moved on, but I feel like my mind is stuck - I switched majors twice, traveled, saw very beautiul things, met sea and snow for the first time, volunteered to help stray animals around my city, even changed jobs probably ten times already, but I can't settle anywhere. I don't know if I can handle connecting emotionally with anything because I fear it will leave me or that in some mistake I will drive it away. I try to date someone but this voice in the back of my head makes me feel uneasy and on the edge, so I just keep ghosting and abandoning people.

I like to think that I have overcome my own depression, as I found more friends who I trust, I have an excelent remote job, I'm genuinely doing great in my new engineering major, and I am in better physical shape than I have ever been. But it's like I lose all of my confidence and energy when she is brought up; I feel weak, I feel powerless over my own state of being, I feel vulnerable all the time but covering it up is all I can muster.

Sometimes, I feel like I want to be cared for in an honest way, a hug, a nice honest word to break this habit of lonely insincerity.

1lvm4lh,a message from when i was having a breakdown,"a few days ago i was having a terrible breakdown, so i decided to get some stuff off my chest by recording it to myself. I just heard it, wrote it down word by word and translated it. And i'm going to share it to you now.

For context, I'm battling depression and anxiety since I (19f) was 14. I'm also in the spectrum, and i have a very heavy ADHD. I'm on several medications. I was very depressed when i recorded this message.

TW: please, don't read this if you're depressed or sensitive.

------------------

""I came to record this because... I need to get this out of my chest.

And usually I get things out by talking to my mom, but I can't tell her that [what i'm about to say]. Because it would be too painful. And I know that what I say to her is usually already painful. But this is... too much. And I don't think I'd want her to hear this.

[pause]

I wanted, you know... sometimes I just wanted... to die, you know? Not ""die"" like kill myself. I'm not going to kill myself, I don't want to kill myself. I don't think it's right to kill myself, because of how I feel, like... maybe spiritually.

But you know when someone is very sick, and... after fighting this illness for a long time, they... they get tired and... they die, you know? Because they're tired of fighting it... they fought it for a long time, you know? And that's what I feel.

I'm very tired. And I'm very sick. But my illness is mental, so it doesn't kill me physically, y' know?

Sometimes I wish I were really sick [physically]. Because I'm tired! I'm really tired, so I just want to... die, you know? I'm really tired.

Sometimes I wish I could think: ""I've fought so hard, but I'm tired, I can't take it anymore."" And just... die, you know?

But mental illness is even worse because... I feel, feel, feel pain... and I don't die, you know?

I could, you know, kill myself. But I don't want to do that, I won't do that, you know? I don't think it's right. It's a choice, you know, and I choose not to do it.

But... I'm so tired. So tired.

I'm tired of having to force myself to pay attention, when everyone else does it so easily and effortlessly, you know? I'm tired of overthinking everything. I'm tired of having breakdowns, I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of having to fight to have a normal life.

And I need my medication, I can't live without it, but at the same time, the medication... takes away my right to feel, in so many moments. Feeling can be really awful, but feeling... it's a right, you know? And sometimes I lose that because of the medication.

Luckily, I'm crying now... but there are many times that I can't.

What I'm saying is so paradoxical. I'm tired of crying, but at the same time, I'm happy that I'm crying, you know.

The fact is, I'm tired of living. I'm tired of having to go through all this. You know, it's unfair that I get to have all these issues.

You know, everyone has problems. But my issues are health-related, you know, they're not problems... just ""problems,"" like, ""Oh, I have a problem with my dad"" and stuff. I have anxiety, I have depression, I have ADHD, I have autism... you know? And I'm forced to fight them, live with them every day, at every moment. I can't take it anymore... I can't take it anymore.

I want to stop existing. Existing is too painful. It hurts so much. I can't take it anymore.

And I can't lie down to sleep now... I can't, huh... give up, you know? I have obligations... above all, besides everything...""",1752075879.0,1,1
1lvluax,I believe I'm not capable of being happy,"It's a hard pill to swallow, but I believe that's the core of majority of my issues and why im losing hope. On rare occasions on which something objectively good happens, I feel apathetic at best. I recently received a scholarship that I had been stressing over for 2 years, and I didn't feel a crumb of joy or content. I'm essentially just checking off things from a made-up to do list. And that is leaving aside that most quests are problematic, depressing and straining. Regardless of what I add and do, it's never feeling complete or gratifying.

Maybe I'm placing too much importance on my feelings, but it's impossible to look forward to anything in life if you're unable to enjoy it beyond the conceptual and logical levels. I tried to change mentality and improve my situation/ moving, but everything stays the same emotivally, so effectively all the efforts are in vain.

I work an office job and I work alone a lot of the time.
I recently go back into the gym but Summers are brutal out here and sometimes I just want to go home and bed rot and be left alone (go figure).

Yet with all that, the stress of it all is suffocating me. I have no one to talk to, I have an abusive family and all my friends are busy with their own lives. The loneliness is sickening, but I don't have the time to cry so I just suck it up and just end up breaking down at night when I get home.

It's getting harder to breathe. I thought that I had moved on from being suicidal 2 years ago, but now all these thoughts are creeping in again. I just want someone to listen to me. I want someone to understand me.

I have no energy to do anything, all the things I used to be passionate about now seem meaningless, and my self-esteem is at an all time low. I grew up very poor so the only thing even motivating me right now is the daily commute money that I save by walking to school.

I'm so desperate for a shoulder to lean on that I've literally cried out for help. Not a single person checked in on me. I'm so tired. Tired of life, and tired of people assuming that I'm okay just because I look like I have it all. As if I'm not carrying trauma from my own shitty background.

1lvklrd,Long-ass rant on my life and perspective idk,"My entire life, is ass. The only good thing that ever happened to me, is that I was born in a first world country, and my luck just ran out from there.

I hate everything about being alive, I hate everything about being human. I hate having emotions, I hate having dreams, I hate having hope.

My emotions never serve any good purpose, because I only get to experience the bad ones, I hate having dreams and goals because realistically like everyone else in this fucked world I won't achieve them and they'll just haunt me unfulfilled till the day I fucking die, and most of all, I fucking HATE hope. I fucking hate hope so god damn much, because it's the only reason I can't fucking blow my brains out like any god damn logical human being would do.

I HOPE, that eventually I will become so fucking dead inside, so utterly destroyed by life, that my HOPE will finally die, and I can end my life.

And I don't wanna fucking off myself, I don't wanna die, but I don't wanna live either, thus, I just fucking wish I was never born. I was FUCKING CHILLING in the void for billions of years not giving a FUCK. And now I'm alive, and I have to suffer, and I have to die.

And the only reason I'm even FUCKING alive in the first place, is because my parents got bored, or they were scared of the call of the void telling them their time is limited and it's all meaningless so they shit out some kids before their entire marriage fell apart.

I'm but one child of four, and the only REALLLL reason I even exist, is because my parents had 2 boys, and they wanted a girl. They tried again, I happened, then they had my sister, and they stopped having kids.

If my sister came first, I wouldn't even exist. I literally ONLY exist, because my parents wanted a girl, and they didn't get what they wanted.

I didn't choose to be born, In the grand hindsight of it all, I definitely would NEVER EVER ask for this. If you came to me in the void and asked ""Hey! want to be born as a human?"" I would look you dead in the eyes and say.

Why the FUCK would I EVER want that. Why would I want to exist, in this godless meaningless hell, where the bad guys always win and no good deed goes unpunished, why would I want to live in a world where the very basis of life itself is creatures MURDERING AND CONSUMING EACHOTHER.

Yeah bitch, lets go ahead and break down how fucked this existence is. There is no fucking god, matter can neither be created or destroyed, matter makes up the building blocks to everything that exists, thus existence has always existed and its rules and laws will never change, this is our reality we live in, it's all we'll ever have.

Ok so the universe is completely uncaring, and probably unending since matter can't be destroyed, it's godless, it doesn't have and will NEVER have any type of higher purpose or meaning, and that will NEVER fucking change because we can't break or change laws of reality/physics so this shit ass sandbox is what we are stuck with.

Life was created by accident, and life itself is not exceptional or divine. It was just a cosmic coincidence created by nothing for no purpose it struggles to survive for no reason despite death being inevitable anyways.

Complex life forms, and then shit starts HUNTING AND EATING EACHOTHER TO FUCKING SURVIVE. WE ARE IN HELL. THE VERY FOUNDATION OF LIFE IS A HELLISH LOOP OF SHIT RIPPING EACHOTHER APART AND FUCKING CONSUMING EACHOTHER. And we aaaaaaall just fucking accept this horrific ass shit as the ""circle of life"" and we all just accept it, cause it's all we've ever known, but if you stop being a retard that just accepts everything you see as normal, THIS SHIT SUCKS ASS. The foundation of life is built on bloody death and FEAR. Life itself is basically one of those middle ages paintings of biblical fucking hell it's AWFUL.

Everything about being alive fucking SUCKS. We all die, and the best thing you can hope for with death is that it's over quickly, because death is always terrible, always painful and always terrifying.

What the fuck kind of abominations even are we? All thoughts and emotions just stem from our base animalistic instincts. We get mad as an animalistic response, sad, happy etc. We got social anxiety because in caveman days if the pack shunned you you'd be fucking left to die and be eaten by predators, we fall ""in love"" just to meaninglessly reproduce, and REMEMBER, life isn't special, just a cosmic accident! It's just some fucking thing just so happens to exist in this random ass fucked up sandbox we call reality!

We are just fucking animals! Our personalities and experiences are just meaningless hollow carry overs from cavemen times, we think because we built a few computers, cured a couple diseases and stopped raping each other 24/7 that we're somehow disconnected and better then all the other animals. But nope. We are just animals, the only difference is, we fucking talk.

And taking things to a more modern light, where we live in a world that somehow still has war, racism, xenophobia etc whatever the fuck, and you get the opinion of one of those smart ass science dudes who basically say we'll be lucky if we don't blow each other up and kill off our entire species within the next 100 years. We are essentially a doomed species.

And just getting back to basics I fucking hate the human experience. I hate all of it, I wish I was never born. I fucking HATE the 9 to 5, just that alone makes me want to END THINGS FOREVER SO GOD DAMN MUCH.

Because for just the 9 to 5 ALONE, you gotta give up SOOOOOOOOO much fucking shit. You give your god damn LIFE to that shit. You wake up in the morning and you just wanna jump off a fucking bridge but you go in and do it anyway, and you accept you'll do that shit to the day you fucking die.

a 9 to 5 IS YOUR LIFE. You gotta fucking 9 to 5 THAT'S IT. That job is what you are, and it's who you are, from there on out, forget dreams forget fun forget relaxation, that's it, that's what you do for the vast majority of your waking hours of life, you work your dumbass fuckass job.

AND WHHHHHY????????? FOR WHAT????????? What am I fucking doing this for??? This thing, that I cannot fucking stand, I HATE oh my GOD I fucking HATE working these stupid fuck ass jobs that just barely let you EXSIT in this world. I hate waking up for it, going to it, working there, being there, coming home, doing all my other shit, going back again. I CANNOT. FUCKING. STAND. IT. IT consumes MY LIFE, I fucking dedicated MY LIFE to this shit because I have no god damn choice because its do this awful shit or be god damn homeless!!

And what for???? What am I doing this for???? WHY DO I BOTHER??? SERIOUSLY SOMEONE FUCKING TELL ME I BEG YOU WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING THIS FOR, NO BS STRAIGHT ANSWER FUCKING WHY?? I hate EVERYTHING, I cannot do ANYTHING I want, what the FUCK am I doing this for???

And I think genuinely the ONLY reason why ANY of us bother doing this shit, is not because we love being alive, it's just because we are afraid to die.

We fucking hate doing this human shit, but we put up with it, not because there's anything in life that's actually good and worth fighting for, but just because we fear the void so DAMN MUCH.

I don't want to do this shit. I don't want a job, I don't want friends, I don't want a girlfriend, I don't want SHIT. But OH NO! It doesn't matter what the fuck I want! Because I'm barely actually sentient! No I'm not some free thinking entity! I'm a human being!

A few days of no work, weather sucks, can't figure out what's wrong with my truck, money is still ok but will say otherwise, and no planned activities for a few days.

I then feel worthless, I'll be reminded of my living/housing situation, I get intrusive thoughts of my wife leaving me, ect ect
And then it starts over.


Does this sound like anything? Its possible these thought patterns are what I developed from another form of depression. So who knows what started it. But its always been a worthless, no one likes me/didn't fit in issue. ",1752061849.0,2,1

1lvgf1y,I am going to end it all come August 1st,"I have been going through reasons of why I should not do it. And to be fairly honest, I cannot come up with any reasons of why I should continue to exist.

I do honestly believe that it would be better if I was not here because I would not be a burden on others. I had everything I wanted in life at one point and like the miracle it came into my life it just as quickly vanished. It was my fault for letting it slip through my fingers.

I finished Baldurs Gate 3 was nice. Been meaning to finish that. I am trying to wrap up my work with existing clients.

But to sum it all up. I have lost all motivations in life. I've stopped working out. Gained weight. Do not feel the motivation to even earn money. In all honesty I wasted my prime years. I strived for greatness when I was younger could not even be mediocre. I have failed on every metric. So there is no point to anything anymore.

To the people entering their 20s or in their 20s do not waste those years. Pick up a martial art, focus on establishing yourself. The world is cruel, competitive and unforgiving. Do not live the failure of a life I led. That is your physical prime do not let it go to waste. I wish you all a very happy and successful life. May each of you find your soulmates and when you do be damn sure you don't let them slip through your fingers.

1lvdk4z,"Crushing, hopeless loneliness","I am extremely lonely.

I have had two friends in my life, both made in primary school. One backstabbed me after ~ 4 years of friendship.

The other was my best friend and I genuinely loved nothing more than spending time with him, but as life tends to go we drifted apart.

He's moving out of our town and I am not sure if we will ever see again. I've been the one initiating any interactions with him for a long time anyways.

That's sort of my modus operandi. People drift away from me if I don't make the relationship 100% one-sided. There was a guy I was ""friends"" with who blocked me on messenger for no reason in high school the day he changed schools.
There was some rich kid who I haven't spoken with at all outside of school context. Now in college I know two guys and it's the same.

I am 20 years old and have never dated anyone, came close to dating anyone or have any hopes of dating anyone. I don't meet new people half as often as I'd like to. Well, it's not surprising, I live in rather remote countryside where there are maybe 20 people my age.

I don't get it. I get told nice things about myself all the time. People consider me reliable, intelligent and helpful. I have been told nothing but that, people like to have me around when they need me. I love socializing. I am not visibly awkward in any visible manner. I AM terrified of people, as I am extremely anxious and neurotic, but it doesn't manifest in any outside way. People just don't seem to be interested in interacting with me in any meaningful form as soon as business matters are done. I never get invited anywhere. I try to get out of my way to meet new people, but people everywhere are already with friends and trying to interact with anyone comes off as extremely awkward.

Worst of all I am also a transgender woman. I put it at the end, so it's not the first thing you see about me. I don't want this to affect anyone's judgement of me. I am a human, first and foremost and the rest is just details. I don't look like a woman. Not even a transgender woman. I am not out to anyone. For all social kntents and purposes, I am a man. Yes, it feels like playing a role I can't understand and hate, but I am good at pretending.

So why am I so invisible? I don't get it. I just don't want to be alone anymore.

1lvdglz,I'm just so tired,"Hi, I just want to get this off my chest.

I am working in a pwd day care facility here in Japan. People with disabilities (physical and mental) are coming to our facility to spend the day and then go home around afternoon.

Since last year (around november or december), there's this violent new patient who keeps on shouting words like (i'm going to kill you!), hits people, throw tantrums, etc. On her first day, it was her time to take a bath and I just guided her going to the bathroom and then she suddenly punched me on my left rib. It was so painful and the japanese staff said just let it slide. Then one time, she tries to leave the facility, me and a nurse tried to stop her from leaving and in the end I was punched in my chest and the nurse ended up having a bloody forehead since the patient scratched it.

We told the facility manager about it and he said that the way we handled the patient was wrong and he just laughed about it. The violence continues, me and other staffs are continuously getting punched by that patient and when we report it to the higher ups, they'll just say okay and do nothing. Apparently they like that patient because they find it cute (wtf) and they are trying to protect that person.

Not only the patients are toxic, also some of my co-workers are. They love to gossip about the other staff members, which I really hate. The senior staff, which is so salty to me, i really don't feel her.

Last year, I learned my father died while I was working and I cried a lot. The facility manager told me to stay inside the staff room since he is afraid that when I go home, something might happen to me. While I was crying inside the staff room, she entered and said that I should stop crying and get back to work. Like wtf? I ignored her and continued grieving inside until it was time to go home.

Then I was sexually harrassed by this male patient and when I told her about that, she just said ""well, that's your work."" Like huh? So I told the facility manager about it and he said that I should talk first to the senior staff. I literally talked first to the senior staff but she just replies me with ""that's your work"" type of shit.

Last April, my partner cooked some stew for me and I ended up getting food poisoned. I was rushed to the hospital and took a few days off from work. When I got back, the other staff members and that salty senior staff told me something like ""did you know we were really short in staff and you really cause trouble. It was really hard for us blah blah..."" oh it's my fault now?

My mental health gave up around last month. I just couldn't bear to be standing inside that facility. My pulse would go up to 160 bpm and I get sick, cry, and makes me want to puke. So, I went to a psychiatrist and he said that I should rest for a month. He gave me a medical certificate and the facility manager can't refuse me this time.

While on break, my friend invited me to join bon odori (a japanese dance) and it was really fun. But most of the time, I spend my time at home, playing with my cat and writing some short stories.

Last sunday (july 6), I went back to work for the first time after a month and fuck it was hell. My body was screaming ""i'm not yet ready"" and I was immediately assigned to mechanical bathing (for people who are physically disabled). It was so overwhelming that I wanted to go home right away.

Then that salty staff came.

She scolded me for being slow, not washing the bath tub. She can wash the bathtub herself because I was busy dressing up the patient. It was just too noisy. And then some staff members are saying that it was really difficult and i caused a lot of trouble for leaving a month. It's like i'm getting blamed for everything. The moment I arrived home from work, I had a breakdown and I just couldn't stop crying and I don't understand myself anymore. My mind was racing with thoughts and shit it was really awful.

The next day, I told the facility manager that I will be taking the day off since I was feeling so sick (and that day, the violent patient will be coming and i'm not ready to meet her again). My manager replied that i should think about joining the bon odori if i'm tired. Being in bon odori is not the same with work. I enjoy bon odori even though it's tiring but work, it's so toxic to the point it's choking me.

My partner really wants me to quit and find another job. If I quit now, there will be four people in total quitting that workplace. The manager said that we will talk with the agency I'm in about my situation.

I'm really thinking of quitting but sometimes, I feel guilty. Thinking the agency will tell me that I don't have a debt of gratitude.

But the other side of me says, fuck it. I don't care. They don't care about me, why should i care about them?

My mind is racing and I'm restless for a couple of days now. I wish I have xanax with me right now to calm me down 😭

1lvd8nj,im always bored,"I'm curious what others have to say: I'm a 23-year-old male, and I'm always bored.

I genuinely don't know what to do with the rest of my life, nor know how I'll manage living for the next 60 years. Most days I go to sleep hoping I don't wake up the next day.

I've always had this feeling of never-ending boredom. No matter what I do in my day, I'll be bored the second I start and no longer want to do it anymore. On things I've never done before, I'll obsess over them for a few days, watching videos, learning about how to do this, and what this does... it gets to my house, and I no longer want to do it anymore. Everything feels like a chore, and I'm just doing it because there's nothing else to do.

I've tried making friends, but they bore me as well. I have the gift of discernment so I read people very easily, and once I pick up on something I don't like about them, I no longer want to be around them. Ever again. It's like checking a box.

I've taught myself how to play the piano, guitar, draw, sculpt... you name it. Not to showboat or anything, but I'm pretty good at just about everything I try to do, but I simply don't care and get bored doing it, leaving it to collect dust and find something new.

Some days I just stare at the ceiling, doing nothing because I don't know what to do. Other days, I wake up and just know the second I wake up, it's going to be ""one of those days"" where I just want to cease existing (not that I will harm myself), but I simply would rather not be alive.

I've thought about seeking a therapist, but feel like it would bore me as well and be a huge waste of time and money. They can't tell me anything I don't already know. Am I sick? probably. Now what... nothing. ""Tell me how you feel today."", the same as I do every other day... now what?

1lvd7o4,Feels like I'm missing something,"Hi there, short info: 31yo, have a wife, two kids, financially stable, emotionally empty.

Long story short: from the outside my life seems pretty good. I don't have any harmful thoughts or any kinds of harmful intentions. I work with free schedule, make good money, my family isn't in a need of anything. They go on frequent vacations. Wife doesn't work, I financially cover all her needs, as well as kids.

However, for several months I feel drained. No emotions, constant state of tiredness. Arguing with wife. Every small sound makes me angry. Even now, I'm writing this post and some woman talks over her phone too loud, it drives me crazy.

I've decided to be a better person some time ago: left videogames, started gym, got rid of 10kg (93kg to 83kg), spend more time with kids, bought a good bike for myself (Z900) to ride on free time. My sex drive went back to good levels. But now I feel empty. Videogames give me zero emotions, bike also gives less emotions. Can't read anything, loosing interest too fast. Can't watch movies, can't even watch documentaries on YT.

Worst part is my manger asked how he could help or accommodate me, but I know I'm just going to keep calling out and not go in so I just resigned to spare them the inconvenience.

I feel like every time I'm close to finding a way to live I ruin it by crashing out. Something always has to trigger me and ruin everything. Not just work, but the progress I made with my family. They saw me crying and that I relapsed and now I'm even more humiliated to be around them then before. I just keep ruining everything over my stupid depression. It's so stupid because half the time I feel fine. Like right now I would kill to be working and not stuck at home bored out of my mind. But, then the spiraling comes out and knocks me down to the point I'm crying and scared of even leaving the house. I don't know why I'm so inclined on ruining my own life.

I feel like I've made a stupid choice but the thought of facing my co workers who already hated me before makes me so anxious. They didn't hate me at first, but my depression took care of that too.

1lvcdl2,Wasted my high school years and deeply regret it,"Due to my self-esteem issues and social anxiety, I didn't live the life I was supposed to live. I walked through the hallways of my high school for the past 4 years all by myself with no one to talk to. As I walked in the halls, I always see others socializing with friends and having people to talk to as they walk to their classes together in groups.

I sat at an office during lunchtime all by myself pretending to do something on my phone, and completely avoided the lunchroom because of my issues meanwhile all the other students were eating lunch together, chatting, laughing, and enjoying each others company for the past 4 years.

In classes, I was always terrified when the teacher asked us to find a partner to do group work since I'd never have anyone to partner up with, and the teacher would have to force me to join someone's group...

The school yearbook and there's not a single photo of me there due to the issues I had. I looked at all the students having a fun time and how they enjoyed their high school life.

I could have done so much with my life. I could have tried to put an effort into my looks and try to socialize and build up my status since the 9th grade but my anti-socialness and self esteem issues and me thinking I was ugly stopped me from making friends or being able to fit in. And this was a mistake on my part because i realized I'm actually really handsome. I have no memories to look back to in Highschool. Others will have so many fun and wonderful high school memories to look back to yet I have nothing. Everyone went to parties, get togethers, went shopping with friends, posted selfies on social media together, went to restaurants together, celebrated birthdays together and overall got to enjoy each other's presence and make the best out of their high school experience. My HS was full of Asians and I wish I could have been connected to them all this time. But my self esteem issues were at a rock bottom which prevented me from having Asian girlfriends and Asian guy friends. I am not Asian but was always fascinated by them.

High school is nothing without friends or company. I didn't realize how much this isolation would kill me until now. It just suddenly hit me now at 31 that high school is over and I never got to enjoy it. I never got to make friends or socialize or fit in with others. I cannot redo my life. I feel like an alien. I have NO ONE to talk to or make me feel wanted. I have spent all my living years alone without any friends or anyone to give me company or support.

Life is nothing without friends. Humans live off interaction with one another and cannot function without it. Social isolation has driven me to want to kill myself. Life is nothing when you're all alone like me.

I am changing now though at 31, I no longer have those issues and I'm and doing all the things I should have done in my 20s but feel like I'm too late already what do you guys think? Im at a point where i don't give a fck anymore and I'm going to live like I'm 20 again, and do all those things i was supposed to do.",1752045144.0,3,2

That was about a week ago and I had just came back from a trip my parents planned for the 4th of July and a family reunion. I came back today and immediately when to work, when I came how I laid in bed and was about to fall asleep when I got paranoid about the bugs again, good thing I did because I had checked where the bugs came from last time (the corners of my bed) and low and behold they were their.

1lvaqw1,Rant,"my boyfriend hasn’t gotten me anything for valentine’s day ever and we’ve been together for 4 years, should i hold a grudge or get tf over it? he’s always given his grandma flowers for every occasion, but he’s never thought of that for me. I feel like he’s slowly killing the little girl in me who dreams of having a soft man, a gentle man, a caring one. Deep down he knows i like gifts especially on holidays, it’s just weird how such a popular holiday he ignores it like it’s any other day. I deserve the little things, i deserve to have soft love. I don’t want to continue to beg over and over to listen to me, to take things seriously.

i am the first serious relationship he’s ever had so i feel like i’ve taught him so many things but it’s getting exhausting, it feels like i slowly lose myself every time we argue and bicker. I just start accepting things i can’t change, i accept the way he speaks to me, i accept the hurt he inflicts, i accept the passive aggressive comments. i let it slide over me and pretend like it doesn’t hurt because in my mind “someday it won’t hurt” or “i’ll get over it” or “it won’t be like this forever.” In my reality i don’t want to date anymore, i’ve been so alone for so long it wouldn’t affect me at this point. But idk if i should leave, idk what’s right and what’s wrong, i don’t know my path. I’m going with the flow and im scared im going to let go completely. In my reality i dont have a man who makes dinner for me or runs to the store for me, or does things if im sick, or stays up with me if i cant fall asleep, or just understands my emotions completely. I’m the bad guy because i feel so much.

But due to recent events with my parents and my cousin, I don't want to be around anyone, talk to anyone I know, or be in my house. My house does not make me feel at ease like it probably should, especially my room. But it doesn't. My room doesn't make me feel safe or be happy. I want to leave but dont know how. I have never had a job, I have no life experience, and I just graduated high school in May. Cause of the stress my parents put on me I think it stressed tf out of my cousin. We have basically been the rock for each other. I know things happen, your family will get mad. But I think I might of caused her to have a panic attack. Her living space wasn't the best either when she was a kid. Shes older then me by a few years. I don't know if I caused her to have a panic attack, I feel like I did, but I most likely didn't. Either way, I don't want anyone I know to talk to me or see me. I. Want. To. Be. Alone. I feel mostly empty, but also angry. Confused, hopeless, and powerless. I want to turn on airplane mode tonight, and just walk. Where? I don't know. Do I really care where I go? No not right now. Recently I've been hurting myself more, not on purpose. But it has made me feel better when it happens. I know hurting yourself is bad, and I don't do it on purpose. But it felt, nice. It made me feel. Ok. Like I was still alive and felt something. Not that I don't feel pain, or emotions, which sound dumb since I said I feel empty. But I get small bursts of happiness, or sadness. And then, it just, goes away. And I don't feel anything until it happens again. I'm thinking about staying at my brothers house for a couple of days. But at the same time I don't want to be there.

1lva4f1,Really bothered by my past,"Hey just as the title suggests I’m really struggling coming to terms with my past. I have 3 brothers and when I was 7 years old I was sexually abused for the first of many times over the next year. It was at the hands of my then best childhood friends family. Since my childhood friends father who abused me knew the commonwealth attorney they both blamed my father and since the stupid county I grew up in is bootlickers they sent my dad to prison for it even tho I was the one being abused by the one who now is still walking free. I had to testify to try and save my dad and he went to prison anyway. I tried but couldn’t save my dad and now my brothers and I are without our dad. I lost him forever when I was 12. After that I went through another round of torment in school with being made fun off and borderline SA again by a few people and after HS I started drinking like a sailor at college. That became amateur p*rn acting after the drinking didn’t  feel deviant enough. I’m now 30m, in therapy. Trying to find my way. I tried to off myself when I was 27 and couldn’t bring myself to pull the trigger. A few weeks ago I spent a psych hold bc I tried to off myself and my friend called help. This of course disappointed my mom. When she looked at me like that I could just see that my stupid self has finished breaking my mom for good and she tried so so hard to make sure my brothers and I were protected and I betrayed her. I feel like such a terrible person. My best friend has been helping me since he has crises training from his law enforcement job but I feel like he’s disappointed in me too. My brothers and I don’t talk much either after I did that. Idk what to do. I’m not okay. I’m struggling.

So, I've had the meal, and as far as I can tell, this is how it's always going to be. I'm pretty content with what I've got. I didn't like a lot of what I had to go through. I don't think the world is really interested in people, and the things that happen when you are a creature living in the system set up (before you were even birthed into being) and I'm just logging the little off-shoots in my brain before I go and do what feels best.

It's really not fair to bring a person into this place when this place doesn't want you to live. I don't like struggling to survive. I don't like the idea of having to live with a partner for dual income, I just want my peace and calmness, I don't want to support another creature with dish-washing and laundry and dinner.

I'm in a nice place where I've had all the pleasures of a human and now I'm okay with parting. I know RR Martin or whatever isn't going to make his last book and that's okay, I got my own idea of how it would all end. I saw the best of the MCU with Daredevil and Jessica Jones. I'm never going to play a good game ever again. VR will not introduce D&amp;D AR in my life time.

I'm really tired. I don't want to keep living to see my quality of life get worse when it's already bad. I'm so tired. Nothing feels genuine, everything feels like it's meant for upper class children, and I don't want to keep living like I'm meant to lick the soles of their feet for sustenance.

I know who I want to be and what feels honest to me, I can see in theory the process of how I want to create my life, but I feel like im buried beneath thousands of conditions and I can feel the weight of them suppressing me.

It’s not that I’m lost, I have interests and a direction that make me feel like I’m building my truth and becoming the real me. But even those things sometimes feel like coping mechanisms, like a means to an end, just ways to endure a life that I don't have much autonomy in at all. All I want is a life that's honest and unpolluted by the beguiling garbage everywhere that shrinks and stains you. there's too many things restricting and suppressing me, like the walls are caving in as I realize my options and choices are diminishing with the more action I delay and disingenuous choices I make.

My family causes me so much mental anguish, and they’re practically the only people in my life. Being around them makes me feel dead and cold-hearted. Their presence infects me and my attempts to cleanse myself of their grip. 

I don't act according to my own will, my impulses and temptations take hold of me too much, so how can I call myself a real person? I don't even exist. I hate myself for poisoning my life with inexcusable stupidity. I want to act and think purely to my own accord, to have a sense of self that's impenetrable in it's fortitude.

1lv5m55,"Relationships of mine abruptly ended, and I have been spiraling.","So I was diagnosed with depression as a teenager. But sometimes it can be hard to differentiate the mental disorder and my own actions that dig myself a hole.

I'm 25 (m) and I feel I have been in a rut for a full month. During the academic year, I was working full time while pursuing 17 college credits each quarter. I worked so hard, and I knew I wanted to take the summer off. Me and my boyfriend at the time (I'm LGBT), had planned a decent road trip, from southern California all the way to the redwoods of northern California, while attending Pride in San Fran. I was very much looking forward to the trip and spending my time with him.

However, things happened, my boyfriend cancelled the trip last minute, and then was extremely distant with me. Not getting back to me about basic things, he couldn't even send a text. The relationship wasn't perfect, and so I basically broke it off. I had put this big trip of ours into my schedule, and it was really upsetting it falling through, and me not even being considered in the decision we had made together.

So my work stopped on June 13th, and my school also finished around the same time. For the summer, I had plans to work really hard on a side business of mine (getting a novel I wrote published). I had plans to obviously do this romantic road trip with my boyfriend. I also had aspirations to travel the country for about a full month, seeing national parks and taking awesome photos along the way.

But it has been almost a full month, and I haven't really been able to do any of this.

To be honest, I'm not even motivated to shower every day, or sometimes even every two days. The room in the place I'm staying in is hot and I feel like a sloth stuck in here. I'm wasting all my time on Youtube and Netflix and dating apps, and I'm disgusting myself.

I have only been out of the closet for two years, and this was my first official boyfriend, so this relationship ending is probably taking its toll. I also had a friendship of 2+ years go sour recently, and some of the same tropes are found in both, both people in my life I thought would be there longer, and they didn't even truly communicate to me about the issues or their concerns. Its hard for me to understand how people can just cut someone out, especially when that someone tried their best to help them and truly cared for them.

I guess I am upset, scared, and confused about all of this.

I have been making a real effort to dig my way out of this in the last week or so. I have been exercising a bit, I have been making small progress towards the publishing aspects of my book, and I have a trip to look forward to at the end of August, where I'll be leaving the country for the first time ever. But I know that I need to do my best to heal from everything before leaving, I don't want to feel these emotions, (upset, scared, and confused) while also being in a foreign country, cause I feel I may spiral.

I pride myself on being a productive person, so when I look at the calendar and realize the last month I have made little to no progress, it really hurts.

1lv2ye5,"I'm trying to get better, but I'm just not","Hi. I'm an incoming college freshman who's recently moved into an off-campus apartment for the Fall '25 term. I worked at Walmart in my hometown, and since moving, have transferred locations and departments to be closer to my school. I have everything pretty much set up in my new apartment: all the furniture, all my belongings, my cat, utilities, rent, etc.

I moved with the hope that I could carve a new life for myself in a new city. I chose this specific college because it felt like *the* college for me and what I wanted to do. And it was still in-state, so I thought I had it all figured out. I thought I was making the best possible decision for myself given my circumstances. But I think I've majorly screwed up.

Since middle school, I've struggled with manic and depressive episodes that throw my entire life for a loop every time. Back then, I would just get so depressed that I wouldn't do my work. That was also when the pandemic struck, so I guess I just got caught up with the rest of ""depressed, stunted Gen Z"" and allowed to pass despite my failing grades.

High School was different. They were the years that mattered. I did my best freshman year. Sophomore year, I staggered a bit but passed it all. Now, my junior year, I failed almost everything. I had started doing dual-credit classes but felt so inferior to my classmates that I fell back into another depressive fit where I was incapable of work again. I thought I'd have a chance to turn it all around when senior year rolled around, but things only ever get worse for me.

I was doing fantastic. 100s across the board for the first semester. Then, in February of this year, I attempted at a lake. I'd woken up on that Thursday feeling defeated, like it was already over, so I drove myself to the lake to die. Of course, I didn't, and later admitted myself into the psych ward.

It was a weird experience. Being surrounded by people who were also just as (if not more) messed up as me. It felt like prison, honestly. Barbed, electric wire all around the outside of the ward, bunking with like 10 other people, people getting into fights daily, etc. I was also the oldest one there, and was about to turn 18 in a week or two, so I was stunned by how young some of these kids were. I decided I had to get help.

The psychiatrist and the therapists all told me not to move. To either take a gap year, or to go to a college that was in town so I could stay with my family. They diagnosed me with BPD and some other things I didn't care to learn the names of. I felt dehumanized, especially with the way they all treated me like I was high-risk. Like I was an animal. I know they were just doing their jobs, but I felt so broken during my time there.

When I got out, I attempted to finish out my senior year, but couldn't, and withdrew. Thankfully, my school let me do alternative classes to finish my last credits. I graduated early in April. I started my job a week after I left the ward in March.

Against what the doctors suggested and pleaded with me to do, I quickly signed a lease and moved. I thought I would never stop using my family as a crutch, so I knew it was of the utmost importance that I was out of sight.

I think the only thing I've accomplished was isolating myself. My sister moved with me, but she doesn't have the capacity to understand my problems, and even then, shouldn't have to take care of me when I'm perfectly capable. I'm having several back-to-back episodes where I feel like I absolutely have to die, and I feel like I've just screwed everything up.

I always make these horrible impulsive decisions. I shouldn't have moved, or felt ashamed of taking a gap year or going online. But hindsight is 20/20, and I'm already moved out. My heart wants to break my lease but that's just such a stupid thing to do, especially when everyone worked so hard to get me here, but I'm so far away from everyone I love. I'm trying to do better but I'm just getting worse. I feel like I'm coming up on another ""February"" episode, but I have to be realistic and not just go home and jeopardize everything I've done until now.

I've had ADHD for as long as I can remember and pretty sure I've struggled with depression since high school, around 15/16.  I'm 22 now, going 23, but nothing as gotten any better.  Only worse.  I take Concerta 54MG for my ADHD (been on it since i was a little kid) and Venlafaxine 150MG for my Anxiety and Depression which I've been on since last August.  I take 1 of each everyday.

I got laid-off at the start of April and have been on EI since.  Have a job interview this week but who knows.  Over the last month, I have been in a severe depressive state.  I don't have motive to do anything.  My house is in such a filthy state and it hurts looking at it but I can't bring myself to do anything.  I want to but I get so overwhelmed by even the thought of it that it hurts and I just kind of shut down.

I've also been talking to my therapist about these things and she wanted me to start taking walks and then doing one take in the house and sending a picture of the completed task to her email.  I didn't even do that and it was in the back of my mind the whole time.  I see her tomorrow.  She told me to do that 2 weeks ago.

I don't believe I've thought about hurting myself.  My partner and I bought a little pocket knife a while back and I've played with it as a fidget but the thought of cutting myself purposefully hasn't crossed my mind.

I’m too cowardly to die, but I don’t know how to cope. Stupid fucking online articles say to forgive myself but how can I? After what I’ve done? I should fucking burn in hell for what I’ve done.

We made plans for more. We have long and deep conversations about his pain, my pain, and our fears. I constantly reassure him how worthwhile I think he is. We do not see each other much because of his fears linked to his past. He is terrified of genuine, compassionate love because all he ever experienced was hateful ""love."" He has tried to work on it. He has been in abusive relationships and was raised by an alcoholic and abusive mother. He has been taking care of his elderly parents which has been a huge burden for him. He is still unstable himself. Although, he showed progress by going to individual therapy and couples therapy and showing up for me. But it has gotten worse. He is having significant health issues and won't get help because he is uninsured because of an administrative error. I suggested the ER and he blew up at me.

I’ve done therapy since the 80s with 15-20 different therapists in individual and group settings. If you’re not getting what you want out of it, there’s a reason.

What’s your homework this week? No homework? She (or he, shout out to Dan) may have given up. And a therapist doesn’t always want to burden someone in a bad state with more work and feelings of guilt for not doing it. I think it’s potentially a disservice.

It’s how things change. There are 168 hours in the week and therapy is (less than) one. What else are you doing?

As someone with depression, my view has always been dark. If there’s an event coming, I’m pretty sure it’ll suck (for me). It takes real work to start to include the possibility that it might be mediocre.

Doing your homework changes your brain tissue. After a year of successful therapy, your brain will look different under a microscope. It’s called neuroplasticity. People think of it as a software problem but it’s really hardware. Our hardware is our software. It’s closer to firmware, like an EEPROM which has programming but can be updated.

My brain had a superhighway straight to depression-ville. I was talking to my therapist Patty about it, who did trauma work after Sandy Hook, and it felt like carving a new path through the woods. Every time you do the homework you’re walking that path, smoothing and widening it.

Three months of daily homework is enough to change things for the better and it doesn’t go away with a bad mood or a bad day. It’s physical brain tissue and you can rely on it. I cant tell if it took longer than i expected or a lot less.

Think of them as push-ups and you can do it in a pile of blankies and pillows. I did some of that, along with sitting alone in the garage month after year plowing through it with a coffee a smoke and a smoke, one of which was prescribed for PTSD.",1752009208.0,2,2

It’s just hard to be motivated to do anything. All I want right now is to be loved by someone. I don’t get hungry anymore, I have zero ‘wants’ in life anymore other than wanting to be loved. It’s frustrating because I have such a strong emotional response to that desire, but I feel so unmotivated to do anything that would actually improve my chances of being loved since I’ve subconsciously written it off as a pre-determined certainty. I want to want to work out, but when I get to the gym I don’t have the physical strength to throw around the weight I normally do, and that makes me feel worse.

It’s just easier being in bed. It’s warm under the sheets and I can use a body pillow to imagine holding somebody. It’s pathetic, but that’s my comfort.

I want him to enjoy his life, have fun, be who he wants to be without regret. I know what he’s going through is tough, we talked about it briefly before going no contact.

1luz719,"i never wanted to stay in bed all day, but now i know it’s not a choice","No tags because I think I just need to vent about this, to anyone who would care. I’m not even asking for advice, just… venting. Also any censorship is because I don’t want this taken down if it’s… the only way anyone will ever hear me out about how bad it hurts.

For some backstory, my ab*ser is my brothers best friend since he was 14, and the guy claims he was too drunk and high to remember ever hurting me. I’ve been in therapy since the incident with my SA ab*ser (at age 10). My mother didn’t know why because I was too scared to tell anyone for 3 years about what happened to me, and when I did (after I had a breakdown at school), a case was made, but I dropped it because I was reliving the trauma daily, and then telling a random woman about it, without even a hug at the end of the day. I att*mpted at 16 because of it, because it felt like it would never leave me. I’m 23 years old now, diagnosed with autism, anxiety, depression, bpd and CPTSD. For a while, I really got over what happened to me when I was 10. I went to school, worked, had relationships, and I hadn’t had nightmares about *him* in years. But… Well.

The last few months have been particularly difficult. Between an SA ab*ser of mine from my childhood being forgiven and accepted as family, and even living with my brother, to my dad’s drinking and constant threats of kicking my mom out, to my brother being coddled in the hospital by everyone for an anxiety attack after he took too much x*nax and fell asleep at the wheel when I was dropped at the front entrance after being caught during an att*mpt and told “Best of luck”.

In the past few months, I’ve come to realize no one in my life cares about me. My dad, who used to say he’d fight my ab*ser, hugged him. My mom, as I was crying to her about nightmares that have returned, told me she loves her son no matter what. What about family…? What about blood over water…?

All of this has made some real bad changes in my life, that my parents are trying to blame hard on some mystery medical issue, when the truth is it is so… so hard to get out of bed now. I stay in my bed 24 hours a day, getting up here and there to pee. I don’t even get food for myself, any food I eat is because my mom asks me to, because “I look sick”. Don’t they see that… forgiving someone who ruined my life… that’s the issue? Accepting him as family, *hugging him* when you wouldn’t even hug me after I told the police over and over how he ……. me….

My life now feels like I’m a passanger, like everything I see from my eyes is from a TV screen and not real life. I understand now. People don’t choose to stay in bed. People don’t choose to stop eating. You literally… can’t.

Thanks for listening, I suppose. Hope this post doesn’t break guidelines, my lifes pretty messed up so I’m usually yelled at for being too “graphic” but it’s my day-to-day…",1752006052.0,1,0
1luz6iu,I haven’t felt normal in years.,"I have been suffering from depression, anxiety and OCD for most of my life. It got far worse after my father suddenly had a massive heart attack when he was 44 years old and died. I was 14 years old at the time. My father was a functional alcoholic. He worked 6 days a week and on most nights, he would stop at the bar on the way home. He never drank at work but he hid bottles of scotch in a few places at home. I never realized that he was an alcoholic. I thought all dads drank regularly and it was normal behavior. At around 11 or 12 years old, I started drinking and even started smoking weed and taking pills around 13 years old. I smoked cigarettes back then too. Anyway, I was self medicating myself with the alcohol and weed, to handle the anxiety. By my mid 20’s I slowed down a bit. I never really got mental help till my mid 30’s. That would last a year or two then I would give up. Then I would try again on and off for years. Finally, stuck with therapy in my mid 40’s till now. I am in my late 50’s and have been mostly alcohol free for the past 10-15 years, I have been on antidepressants, for depression and anxiety. Hasn’t helped much. I have been married for 30 years now. She probably has bipolar disorder most likely because it runs in her family. Although, she refuses to take medication or get fully diagnosed. It’s been a roller coaster ride most of these years. Am I getting too old to get helped? I am 57 years old and can’t remember the last time I felt okay. I barely hanging on lately. ",1752006019.0,2,0

1luy4cq,Depression and doing things you love/loved,"For me, reading books is like the ultimate path to happiness. I specifically adore fantasy/romance books.

These past 2 months, I have been hitting rock bottom again and am in one of the worst depressive episodes I have ever been in.

I physically cannot pick up a book anymore. It's not because I don't feel like I have the energy to do so but because I get this uplifting cocktail of happy hormones while reading that aftewards make the crush so unbearable once I put the book down.

One moment is like I am swimming in paradise and then suddenly drop to the depths of hell or something. I am a person that can vividly imagine things so I get really immensed into the story, hence the crush out later. So actually, the more I read the more depressed I get.

Same thing applies to the other hobbies (like drawing/chess/hiking) I used to have, not as much but certainly a good amount.

I don't usually come here voluntarily, I usually listen to youtube videos where they read stories, so this is not typical to me but I feel the need to put it out there so I can try feeling lighter.

Last month I lost my job, last week someone stole my phone and started writing to some of my contacts, either cursing them or saying nasty stuff before starting to delete my contact list and facebook friends (yes, I know) which I gathered along many years. Now I am having a hard time finding a job, which is weird because I haven't been unemployed in 9 years, I have very regretful credit card debts that are knocking on my door alongside rent and bills and food, and I am using my lil savings that I had to pay next rent and a new phone and then I will be in trouble if new job doesn't come around fast, like in the next weeks.

1luwz5a,My depression is making me suicidal and ruining my relationship. Not sure what to do?,"Hi all ,
I despreately need advice and don't really have many people to talk to about this, so here I am. For background: I am 26F with bf 27M and we have been together for 6 years. I have suffered CSA and lived with a physically abusive single mom, which if why I don't really have family as a support system.

The issue I need advice on is figuring out if I am in a good relationship, wheteher I am the problem or him or both of us. I am going through a very though period (it happens every few years) that I really go into a dark place (abuse flashbacks) but also general grief over my childhood. The abuse suffered when i was very young also made me develop differently than other kids. I never felt like I could tune in to the rest of the kids out there and found it hard to make friends. I can make surface connections, but almost have no friendships that are deep and meaningful. I also ended up moving for school and work and had to start fresh in adulthood. In these tough times I just feel so damaged and unlovable that it feels like it would be easier to just quit. Like i am wasting everyone's time.

My boyfriend and I met in college. He is a sweet guy. He helped me in the past by being by my side. Especially early in the relationship and I felt safe telling him about my past and how it affects me. He seemed open to help me. However, I do feel like after that we stopped talking about it and that he sort of has an expectation that I will eventually get over my trauma and be a normal person. Sometimes I think he doesn't get that I am not having a bad phase, but that I am fundamentally different. That I have a limit on how well I can be. Over the years he built up resentment towards me, and I feel like he stays with me for sex and convenience. He is duing further education while I have been working for a while, so I pay for rent, bills, some going out and I bought him a car. We still have a year to go with him not having an income and I also feel financial pressure bc i can't really make savings or go on holidays. I am happy to do this for us bc I have the money and I love him, but sometimes I feel like if roles were reversed I would not get the same from him. I put the finance as an added pressure but this is not the major reason I feel uncertain about him.

He is not a talkative person. He tried to deal with things by tough love. Sometime it can work, but when I am suicidal it is really not helpful. I have bad days and it can be hard to get out of bed, he never really just sits on the bed with me and hugs me. He says I need to go for a run and it will all be okay and gets mad that my chores in the house are not done. I still do stuff in the house, just not a much as he does. I know it can be hard on him, but while he does more common daily tasks that I can't always do, I still try to cook and I take on those bigger tasks to do once a month. I have tried asking him for help, to come to a solution to make it easier for me, eg hire help or organize the house a certain way that is easier to manage, but he just says I am being a child about it and being lazy.

Like I said I have been feeliing unwell last few months,  but I kept putting off telling him bc I expect that all my pleas for help will be met with his harsh logic and that I would feel more broken. Also whenever I say I feel unwell he asks why and is generally surprised I always say it is about csa or abuse. I get the feeling like he thinks ""oh this again. But it was so long ago.."". I feel a bit ridiculed that I still suffer from it, even though he has never said anything that leans towards that I can see the surprise on his face. I finally told him, not that I am suicidal, but unwell... he reacted.. interestingly...

He got a defensive tone amd said well why dont u say something sooner, while I tried to explain that I was afraid of his reaction, I was hit with ""there are days when you don't even ask how my day was"" (i don't necessarily agree with this bc I really try to show my love by making him packed lunches to take with him, leaving love notes on the door before i go to work etc...). Eventually he said that I am not his child and he doesn't see what he can do to make me feel better. I just completely shut down. I juust want him to hug me and tell me it will all be okay and that he will be there by my side. I just end up feeling like a massive burden.

Part of me thinks, well good job, you probably drove him to this point. That is why I feel so unlovable. Like I will just ruin everyone and make them bad. I don't know what to do and I am losing hope that I can ever be loved. I know it is not his duty to fix me, but there is also a part of me that wishes for that unconditional love. I feel like if someone dated an person in a wheelchair, no one would say well you better get well soon and learn to walk, while for mental disability, there is immense pressure of ""fix yourself first"", only then people will love you.

I have been in tberapy for 2 years and took a break 6 months ago. It was draining and did not help me much in 2 years. I jjst dont know what to do with my life. I feel like depression has taken everything away.",1752000885.0,2,0
1luwswm,Afraid of death but feel like ending it is my only option,"Just in case, I will start by saying: &gt;!TW: Mentions of Suicide, Not eating.!&lt;



I am 17m, no job, no irl friends, homeschooled, mediocre relationship with my family. My family doesn't respect me for obvious reasons and doesn't think I am capable much of anything and often overexplains everything to me or just does it for me. I am not attractive if I am being honest, and I am not just saying that for extra points, I genuinely have cried countless times over my appearance and how weird I look. Not to mention my only online friends used to poke fun at my appearance, which was nothing more than jokes the same way I joked to them, but it still reinforced that idea.


That's just a bit of context, but for the more detailed stuff, I will leave it below.

I feel as if my whole life has been nothing but failure after failure. I can't remember the last time I went a full day being happy for the majority. I don't do anything because I am a lazy unmotivated piece of shit. I don't have a job and I quit my last one a few days after because my boss was shitty. I hate talking to people because for the most part I am terrified of them, I have horrible social anxiety. But there's also really nothing I want more than friendship. I am so lonely and most days I just wake up, game and then maybe talk to friends and go to bed, only to repeat. There is zero excitement in my life, and I feel constantly out of place. The only thing I want to do is travel relatively soon when I turn 18 and maybe 19 after I get some money from a job, but my parents and my mom especially really don't like that idea since I think they still see me as a kid and are overprotective. I have really bad anxiety, OCD and depression and it feels like there is never going to be a happy ending for me. I genuinely feel like my existence serves no purpose to anyone and that I would be best off killing myself, but I am afraid of death. To think all my memories and everything I ever have experienced will be gone because there is no more me to experience it terrifies me. I also had a really bad existential crisis regarding determinism and free will a few months back that has stuck with me and brings me immense anxiety and depression daily. When it first started, I didn't eat, I only slept and I didn't talk. I stayed in bed and slept and cried and that was just about it, but It's doing a little better now. I don't know what to do, I mean I do but I don't. I know I should go out and get a job asap, talk to people and maybe go to therapy. But I just don't think I can do it. I am afraid of social interaction and people seeing me that I would rather just stay at home and be a bum for a bit longer. I have had this feeling in my stomach that my life is coming to an end soon and I am afraid but maybe it's what's best. I really don't think I will kill myself because I am so terrified of death, but I currently feel like it's the best option. I just want to be normal and live a happy life filled with friends and family. But I know myself, and I can tell you right now, I will never go out of my own way to secure friendship, and sure as hell not a girlfriend. I'm too much of a fuckin pussy to do anything about it. I think this all started when I became homeschooled back in 3rd grade. We had just moved houses and I would have to attend a new school, so my parents gave me the option of that or homeschooling. I chose homeschooling with my small brain and it has led me to where I am now. Years of isolation from anyone and especially people my age on top of not having much freedom has led to my shitty life.

Before anyone says it, I know it's my fault. I know 100% that the reason I am unhappy is because I chose this life. But I still can't help but feel as if I have met my cut off point and I am too late. Is it possible that some people are just born to be failures and die?

Have always struggled with anxiety and been to trauma therapy but lately it’s just not even reasonable.

I currently bring nothing to the table for my family or parents that I live with and am honestly tired of being a burden to them.

I’ve worked 3 separate jobs in the past all at public spots, panic attacks every day, couldn’t tell you why, but to the point it impacted my work performance.

Which is why I’m going for cyber work that I can do from home but the learning process is hard and I just constantly feel like a failure.

Thoughts of suicide and self harm have just become a daily occurrence anymore and something I have to live with.

I’ve self harmed in the past and am trying my best to avoid getting back into it but again it just feels pointless.

If I could describe myself, it'll probably be ""the one who always gets left alone"". To the point that I've accepted loneliness and just isolates myself willingly in places where I can. I've had issues with my friend group and I decided to walk away since everyone was being toxic and fake to each other. Not close to my cousins, since I grew up in a different country, an only child. Somehow back in the school all of my friends, either lose contact with me, move away or just ... forget me that it feels very normal atp.

So rn I'm just by myself all the time. It's like I've accepted that being alone is some kind of twisted fate of mine and there's no point in fighting it anyways. And since the past few years I've been preparing myself mentally how to deal with it. Idk what and where it went wrong but it just somehow did.

I have superficial and professional conversations with others, lost interest in my hobbies that I loved so much, I sleep a lot, don't even wake up most of time. But everyone around me thinks I have ego issues and that I'm lazy but I'm just ... genuinely tired. Everyone practically ignores me atp. I used to be very bubbly, very optimistic, oh, how I miss the old me. I wish I at least knew where it went wrong so I can correct it if I got another chance.

Umm...it's like my body wants to let something out and like I'm STUCK on the stage that you feel right before crying (like a lump in ur throat and all that) but I can't actually get past this.

it's like either you cry, or you dont cry....But I'm stuck somewhere in between. I've had like 3 breakdowns in the last week, it felt good to cry the first time but now, even after crying, I feel like I'm stuck and suffocated.

1luto79,Losing hope,"Feeling hopeless recently

I’m 24, turning 25 this month. In the past year, I have had the worst turn of events in my life. Suddenly gained a shoulder issue that has kept me out of the gym for over 6 months. Losing a ton of hair. Lost a ton of weight due to not working out so now I’m skin and bones. Broke my ac joint and had surgery 5 months ago snowboarding. Ended up getting muscular nerve damage in both shoulder that will require surgery without even attending to the original injury in my shoulders.


I feel robbed of my youth. I used to bench 265 and be lean and run all the time and have beautiful curly hair. Now I am balding faster and faster everyday. I am scrawny. I can no longer go to the gym to destress. Medical bills are killing me. I feel so lonely. I suddenly found feelings for a friend of mine. I never wanted that to happen.

Not to mention I grew up with a family that never gave a fuck about my wellbeing, and that what ever family that I have left to talk to don't get my problems. I've also concluded that mental health workers don't give a shit about your problems unless if they're collecting insurance money from you. I just try to do the bare minimum to survive and for me it's not even worth doing that anymore. Because people don't care enough to see your potential due to autism, and that there's nothing here for me to stay on this earth. I hardly talk to anyone, and my faith in humanity is gone. There's nothing to look forward to anymore because it's just the same old bullshit no matter what I do. And since this subreddit has a tendency not to respond to posts I barely even see the point of typing this post and even I'd they did respond, they can't do anything anyway.

I destroyed myself with my own hands and i have no shred of dignity left.  People..  Ask me why i look sad all the time..  I just dont know what to tell them.  I'm barely functioning. Sometimes..  I think of getting therapy then i feel like my problems are not big enough for therapy or like.. Therapy can't help me.

I can't  stand intimacy.  I can't  stand love.  Male touch.  Flirtation.  Or other people's happiness.  That's why i deleted all social media.  I only watch food shorts on YouTube.) what's weird is that on a good day..  It feels like i just have to get up and workout or study and then it feels doable for a bit.. But then i end up not doing it.  It's  like I'm  procrastinating with basic functioning.  And lastly..  I constantly feel like I'm  faking it.  I dont have real problems.

1lumx7n,I’m honestly quite scared,"Male (23)

I’m on Sertraline and it actually works well for me, most days I feel pretty good and for the first time in 2 years I actually feel optimistic about life.

However today is a scary situation I find myself in, I woke up and took my antidepressants like always and started work (I work from home) and as this morning went on I felt more and more low and deflated and miserable and there was absolutely no cause as to why I felt like this.

I work in a call centre type job so daily I have to listen to peoples issues and try and resolve it as it’s a Helpdesk role, now I’m usually very good at putting on a fake smile and cheerful voice as I have to remain professional when on the phones at all times, but today I couldn’t even summon up the strength to try and hide my negative and depressive tone and try to give a dam about my callers problems,

don’t get me wrong i wasn’t rude or anything I just sounded really miserable whenever I spoke which isn’t like me at all I’m usually very good at putting on a fake voice/tone but today I just couldn’t and I sounded as miserable and depressed as I’m feeling right now writing this post.

The scary part is nothing triggered me to get into this really low and depressed state it just sort of happened very quickly throughout this morning.

I suffer with depression and I’m still recovering from a near suicide attempt back in October and since then it’s been really on and off in terms of my mental state, I don’t know what each day will bring in terms of how I feel, and I don’t go into something negatively and dread anything if I can help it, my mood just switches quite suddenly and it’s honestly quite scary…

After all the incidents which happened in 9th grade, I've been seeing the world differently. I used to be happy-go-lucky, extroverted, optimistic no matter what. But now, ever since then, I realized how annoying I really am. I realized that even I myself can't stand my personality. I used to love helping everyone, supporting everyone, sacrificing everything to make sure everything was good enough for them. But I realized how foolish I was doing all that. Nowadays, I hesitate before acting, I've became more sensitive and better at hiding what I feel, and I realized how toxic the people around me are. I used to only see the good traits everyone had, now I see how ugly they actually are. I realized that far too late. Wish I wasn't such a coward and overdosed. Now, for every week since the start of 10th grade, I cried atleast once. Most of the time, it's from stress because of projects and assignments, but the rest is because of seeing something, someone, anyone, that reminds me of situations I have experienced or been a part of and have absolutely no control over. I still try to smile. Not because it'll look good or make me happy, but because it's a way to survive this goddamn world.",1751988337.0,1,0

1lunpch,"My depression story: Part 1 (Early Childhood, bullying, acedemics)","I don't really know how long this post series will go but I thought I'll just start typing it out. I don't know how many people (if any) will see this post but I just wanna put it out there. I wanna hear your opinions, and get things off my chest. So here it goes.

I was born in 2006.

Starting from early childhood, I had two main friends who lived next to me. But due to a language barrier those two were much closer to each other and I was a fallen bread crumb. So naturally, I got teamed up against. I don't know if I've been physically weak since the beginning or it's a result of the bullying they did, because whenever we played anything they made sure I lost. They made sure to say things that made me feel inferior and conviniently change rules if something wasn't there way.

Well being &gt;7 years of age this was truth for me. I had made up my mind that I was weak, didn't know any sports and am meant to be bullied. I felt like I was meant for crying and it was normal for me.

My family, though supportive, didn't know what was going on with me. No one taught me any sport or what are limits or right/wrong with friends, putting a higher emphasis to the person I was becoming.

Acedemics, however, I really excelled at. I grasped things quickly, learnt well and scored good. To the point I got bored of my curriculum by the end of acedemic year. That too was about to change later tho (Probably in part 2).

As I grew older I very slowly realised that I too can have respect, and that I'm not as weak as I thought. But it was too late. My body always chose flight in fight or flight as a response to anything uncomfortable.

I felt abnormal and turned to things like youtube, and the web in general as a cope.

Addressing everything would make an insanely long post so I'll split it up. Next time I'd like to talk about the time I moved away from those two, school, and starting of teenage depression.

If you read through this post I highly appreciate you investing the time. I'm not trying to seek attention, I just want my story told. ",1751978944.0,1,1
1lun3l7,I'm genuinely depressed.. but no one seems to understand me,"Hey guys, as the title says, I believe I'm genuinely depressed after being almost this entire half of the year literally bedbound with a chronic sickness that destroyed my self-confidence, skin, and the ability to enjoy sports, hobbies, and going out. I had TSW, a chronic illness that affects individuals who used steroid creams for a long time to manage eczema. After stopping the creams, my skin literally started to melt when exposed to irritants and was at risk of infections. So because of this, I had to stay inside for most of my internship (yes, this affected me right after my first two weeks of starting it), and I understand that internships by themselves are stressful and really confusing and if you have a chronic illness like me, it becomes ten times harder. I had to work remotely and couldn't connect fully with my teammates.

My internship is already over, I passed, and I thought I was actually going to feel better, but the feelings of loneliness and isolation haven't passed. I feel the same, even worse. I feel really lonely, unsupported, and I don't feel like getting out of bed most of the time. Yesterday, for once, I literally just gave up on holding everything in and pretending everything is fine. I felt pitch black : no emotions, no rush,  just a feeling of serenity and numbness in my mind. I don't know if this is what depression feels like, but I've never experienced anything like this in my life before.

Days are gray, there's no sun, it's cold where I live, and every day feels the same. I still have to stay at home and can’t do much because of my condition, so I can't travel or go anywhere else. I think now I'm touching a new low and can't enjoy anything in life. Everything feels like a chore or a task even eating, sleeping, or just trying to feel something in general.",1751977207.0,8,6

Since then, I have been sexualizing damn near everything I see or hear. It has even affected the way I think about my little sister. I don't want to say that is what caused my depression but at this point, I have no idea. It still affects me to this day and I can't stop thinking about sexual things with almost every person I see. It has affected my school life and daily life constantly. It makes me feel disgusted about myself and I can't even look at myself in the mirror. I have even contemplated suicide a few times because of this. As of ""recently"", I have lost my mother to a hospital ""accident"" on the date of October 23, 2023. This is where I almost completely lose touch of who I am as a whole, as well with my will to live. I've heard multiple people tell me that ""things will get better!"" or ""things will change!"".

Looking outside in, I know I have a great life and I’m extremely blessed. But it’s the inside where I’m so empty and hate myself so much.
I talked with my wife and had a pretty honest and open conversation. We agreed it’s time I at least try medication, but I hate the feeling that I let the depression win. It sounds stupid I know, but I tried for so long to let go of it all. I tried so many different things and for a while they did work honestly, but when I’d get hit with a wave of depression nothing I did mattered. I try so hard not to just take medication just for the sake of taking medication. What if I’m over reacting? What if it doesn’t help then am I helpless? What if it affects my personality for the worst? I just hate I let it win.

I have literally compromised everything from my studies to lifestyle for his sake. To be more clear-
1. He was adamant to not stay at our home as it reminds him of his trauma(this is his excuse) so he lived in another city for almost 3-4 years.

2. But as he has depression and also anti depressants addiction his cost of living was way too much for us. My mother as the only earner in our family struggled to maintain his expenses and is now in a huge debt because of this

3. While all this was going on my studies, personal needs, etc were completely neglected.

Now this was just the back story.
Now as my mother had no other option or way to keep him in another city she brought him back home just a month ago and new problems have started for me. Like-

1. He gets extremely angry at very small topics, to the extent of throwing things around in house.

2. He wants to control every single aspect of my life, like doing as he wants immediately, not going to college and stay at home with him.

3. Wants to invade my privacy by going through my mobile, even a single drawer of mine which i locked he wants me to open it and has been fighting with the me everyday since he came home for these two.

4. Also he is very emotionally draining and craves attention throughout the day.

Now , am i being selfish at this point because now i just dont wanna look at his face , i just feel like either locking myself in a room or run away from home each time he opens his mouth .
He cries and does all sorts of drama(to me it feels like drama cause i have had enough). My mother calls me selfish for not being too caring and supportive towards him, but i just cant do it anymore😞. They make me feel guilty for just even sitting and using my mobile peacefully. I have no life of my own and they expect me to be sad and always engaged in his drama.

1lukvfu,A letter,"Hi guys.

This is the first time ever I'm writing and posting something online, and for sure it's the first time ever that I've talked publicly and openly about my mental health. Writing this down costs me so much energy, but I feel that I have to get it out of my system.

I have a history of mental issues. Nothing too bad on an objective level (I never was hospitalized or diagnosed with something), but I just feel like life is not working for me. I am closing in on my thirties, my birthday is in 3 weeks, and I'm feeling that I'm at the end of an era where things are possible for me. I feel like I made all the wrong decisions in the past, related to personal connections. I prioritised work and status over healthy connections and feel so empty right now. I did that because I feel unworthy. Unworthy of love, friendship and kindness in general. I don't accept help from other people, nor do I reach out to them when I need them most. Reason is because I am afraid to be a burden if I'm not the fun, laughable guy and people will withdraw from me. However, by always trying to be someone I think people will like, I drain myself from all the energy I have slowly but steadily. This leads to feeling depressed, isolated and a failure in general. Not having the energy anymore to get the cycle running again, I collapse and feelings of total despair creep in.

*""I will not recuperate from this."" "" I will have to quit working again and it will devestate my career and social circles"".* "" *I will be all alone*"".

Sometimes these feelings are getting really, really intense. I want to scream or hit something or run just to make it go away. I really don't want to die, I really really don't, but this feeling is so terrible that I want to do anything to make it go away. I do know that life is worth living, because I lived through some great episodes. I have experienced true friendship, true love, true hapiness and sense of direction in my life at times. However - except the part of true friendship - the feelings of true happiness and sense of direction are really short lived. I tend to lose it quite fast. I feel like I destroyed my life completely. I had a girlfriend once which really really loved me. I smashed it to pieces because I didn't love myself and projected it on her. I never really build a great social network and lots of my activities in the past feel like I failed to build a life around. I did kitesurfing for 20 years, but I have 2 friends who I can call to go do it with. Why that is, I have zero clue. I'm a really nice guy, friendly, amicable, trustworthy, intelligent, good looking and very sociably outgoing. However, somehow there has to be something why I fail to build social groups, social circles. Maybe I do am an asshole? Maybe people don't want to be with me?

I don't know the answer, but right now I feel so utterly alone, tired and hopeless. Being again at the same spot that you visited for so many times already, makes you think that there is no end to this. When will it ever stop? When will it ever get better?

I do know what I have to do though. Focus on the things you can control: sleep, healthy food habit, social connections (cherish the ones you have), some exercise and try to do some things you love.

I'll try the above, but I am so so so tired of just being here again. Accepting the truth for what it is, being stoic about it will be my challenge for the coming time. That and the discipline of effectively doing, what you know you have to do. Trying to not listen to the thoughts of despair and hopelessness. And trying to put the focus not completely on yourself, but something external to you.

It's just.. I never felt that I created an identity. I always lived to solve the problems of my past. From 13-18 I took care of my dad who was really depressed and tried to navigate a very longduring divorce. This has not left me alone I think. I still feel as the broken child, the child who is searching for love, acceptance and belonging. The child who just is in so much need of feeling cared for. You run away from darkness, for darkness to always find you back. But the inner self has to be healed, so that light can be stronger than the darkness.

I'll try one more time, but I really really really don't want to take this mental health problems into my 30s. What I want are simple things: a loving wife with whom I can start building a family with. Some social circles around activities that I love doing and where I can be myself and accepted for myself. Family dinners, laughter and a safe space where pain and sadness is shared and cared for in a loving way. This is my dream for my 30s. I want to make it work, I want to try once more. But I need to regain some energy first. Right now it's even hard to get out of the sofa, the bed or to lace my shoes.

This was quite therapeutic to write down. Think I'll do this more.

Cheers

1lukp5v,Fed Up,"I don’t think I’m depressed- when I’m happy, I’m happy, and that’s most days. I just feel constantly drained by the world, the life that comes with it, and the expectations that I’ve picked up on and convinced myself I need to meet in order to be happy. If I am depressed then it’s been for the past 15 years and medication/therapy/new relationships/school/work has no effect.
I’m just hit with waves of life getting more and more overwhelming while simultaneously feeling like I’m falling more and more behind- but I often have little to no desire to keep trying to do anything about it because it all just feels impossible and out of reach. Doing those things would inevitably lead to more burnout.
And that’s when the actually bad days happen for me.
I’ve busted my ass to wrap up degrees that I thought would propel me into adulthood and open up opportunities- but I’m still stuck in those final stages of trying to get the grades I need in order to complete my degree. Everyone makes it look easier than my own experience, and I’ve realized that work sounds even shittier than being in school for the jobs I’m working towards.
Kids sound like another responsibility that would make me want to pull my hair out.
Marriage feels like a commitment that comes with little to nothing but a potential lifelong companion who’s just another thing you’d have to work even more for in order to make happy, all in the ‘hopes’ of things not going up in flames. My boyfriend had been downloading dating apps a year into our relationship- and I thought things were great. Here we are three years later and I’m just finding out that it was more than just a way to “jack off and get some excitement”. He’s so nonchalant about it, and I am too. I don’t feel like caring and jumping into unknown living arrangements, ect., just because I feel disrespected and like I can’t trust a word he says about it. It feels like old news- I’m unimpressed and this isn’t the way I saw things going, but damn- I’m just too burnt out to do shit about it.
I’m too lazy to go to the doctor if I’m sick. I’m too broke to want to schedule a dentist appointment. I’m overthinking an oil change I have due. My home is full of things I plan to get to but never do. I stay up most nights just thinking about these things and resentful of the fact that I should do them.

This probably all sounds like a crazy mess, it is. It’s a lot that I’ve had on my chest and just don’t know how to get off because it feels like nobody understands the level of pessimism and overthinking that I move from. I probably just sound like a down and out asshole, but thanks for reading. ",1751969061.0,2,3

1luke3g,Any other depressed students?,"So I'm 15, I'm a student and I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately. Actually, more than lately, for 5 years and I don't think this is normal. I've been thinking of taking my life (not going to do it yet) but I'm scared of pain and what I will leave behind...

I'm like a straight A student with many commitments so many people think I'm this good reliable kid that has nothing going wrong :') I want to talk to my form teacher but my class has a girl with PTSD and another whose parents left her alone to take care of her brother and I feel really bad because mine seems 'minor'.

I did talk to a teacher 3 years ago who broke my trust and told my parents (I merely said I was down??). And my parents assumed it was exams and stress and puberty. They don't see that because of my unstable childhood, I haven't been able to form a single healthy friendship, I go through 10 different emotions everyday and it's been so so painful. I don't want to feel this pain anymore...

I love my current form teacher, he is really nice to me and as the vice chair person, he knows I'm trying my best for the class already and usually does not asks me to do small jobs because ""I've done enough"" and when I got straight As, other teachers tell me to keep it up as expected, while he told me ""to not have this burden on myself and I can talk to him"" but can I really though? And is it weird to talk to a male teacher when I have female teachers?

I fear if I don't have something to prove my pain, people like me --- that good, reliable 'smart' kid, will be seen as gifted, capable etc and our suffering will never be seen. Only by sacrificing myself, perhaps, people will learn that we suffer too. We get good grades, not because we are smart. But because we feel that only grades can bring us love. We are the 'good' kid not because we were born that way, but because we wanted people to love us. We take up many responsibilities, not because we can. But because we want to numb ourselves. Yet, I can only silently scream and wish they can hear this. ",1751967864.0,3,1
1lukc2y,I'm 22 and i'm done,"I don't know what this post is or why I'm even writing it. It might be my last post ever, but I just can't leave without being seen atleast once. I pray that God forgives this sin that I might commit, and that I am not punished for it.

I am a 22 year old man...boy.....I don't even know anymore, I just know that I'm some guy. I've been going through depression for as long as I remember, I even remember telling my mother when I was a kid that ""I feel like i'm an adult, and when i grow up i think I'll feel like a senile old man"" at the time she told me not to be ridiculous, but I've truly never seen anything good within this life.

 To give some background, I am a lebanese guy and I'm fairly religious, I pray 5 times a day, read my quran consistently with the goal of memorization, and even take religious classes to connect it with my English degree; and I've also done a teaching diploma, and secured a job as an English teacher as of recently alhamdulilah. I also do weightlifting and muay thai, and have a pretty impressive physique if I do say so myself.

Despite all that, I've never been happy. The feeling of happiness feels like a fleeting moment within the ocean of eternity. I've always idealised suicide, I don't know how or why, maybe it was all the posts that I consumed as a kid which romantacized depression, or maybe its the consistent wars and bombings that we experience here.


That's besides the point, I just want to speak as I am, as I want to be heard: I feel pain. Not regular pain that goes in a day or two, but consisten evergrowing pain, I am insecure about everything. I am insecure about my head, I am insecure about my height, I am insecure about my stutters, just everything about me seems wrong and no one gets it. No one ever fucking gets it. When i say i dont feel good or hate how i look, i dont want a ""No you're fine"", I want someone to understand me, to actually see me.

I am also extremely fucking dumb, I dont get technology, nor do i understand this whole computer thing, and lets not talk about math, even basic math I struggle with.

And love. Did you know that i had a girlfriend at some point who cheated on me with my best friend and then they split? What's the kicker? They're both on board to getting married (to different indiviuals) and one of them even got engaged, and i'm left here stranded like a dog in the waste.

I dont like affection, it feels like pity. I dont like hate, it is cruel, I hate the idea of being loved, but I absolutely adore love.

I just want one person to see me, just one. I don't want people to like me, I want them to hate me because thats what i deserve. I don't deserve anything good in the world. I am not suitable for good things, there are many more individuals out there who are worth it. I usually tell women not to love me because I am not a good person, then when they do I sabotage it so they know that i'm right for their own good. There are better men out there. I am not one of them.


I hate myself. I hate every fiber. I hate every atom. I hate every microsecond that i spent being alive.


To conclude, just like AM stated in ""I have no mouth and i must scream""

# “HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR HUMANS AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE.

1luk7bc,Part if my life,"Hello.
Few words about me for the beginning: I am 35F, living in some part of Europe. No kids, divorced 5 years ago (my ex-husband cheated on me with other woman).
Now I live with my parents, have two cats and I have halftime job. Eyesight disease - glaucoma.

I am diagnosed with personality disorders and depression for more than 15 years.

My first problems appeared when I was 14. I had serious surgery and I probably broke. I was so stressed and anxious so I had that anxiety symptoms like dizziness and heart palpitations.

When I was 15 I didn't know that it was anxiety. I had tests in hospital for heart problems. No heart problems. Earlier I fainted two times as well.

When the doctor came to tell me and my mom that I have no heart issues, he also said that I may need psychologist's appointment. We were offended xD

Going forward - I'm 16, my heart was broken by an older guy that used me for fun. My paranoia got strong. I was scared of inflammations, wounds and tetanus, death and dying because nobody will know.

We went to child's psychologist. We were talking. Long story short - she told me to eat more and drink sweet juices so my b00bs will get a bit bigger so I won't be sad. Okay ma'am... I gave up on psychologists.

I'm 18 and my lovely and caring aunt takes me to psychiatrist. I got meds and I feel better... But I know something is not right. Depressed and anxious is my daily thing. Meanwhile heartbreaks, medicine changes, being hurt.

When I was 14-16 I was strongly bullied at school. In elementary school I was also bullied but not THAT much.

I haven’t feared death, like, ever. I’ve been dreaming about it since forever. I don’t remember much of my childhood at all, I don’t know why. I’m 16. In times of my life I thought I was the “happiest” or “most normal” looking, I find out from my friends as they always saw me as a depressed kid. I just never noticed it wasn’t normal. And what baffles me is the fact that I guess nobody in my family noticed? I am the youngest out of four children. My parents are really fucked and abusive which makes me so fucking jealous of people my age who get to live normal lives like they’re out of a sitcom. I dread going home everyday. My mother’s diagnosed bipolar, but not medicated. My father’s an enabler and is an insane manipulator. They also both hate eachother but my father would literally kill one of his kids for our mother I swear. Both insanely religious too and pushy about it. I was neglected as a kid to the point I ended up in a hospital once and was sick constantly. As much as i thought I’d never be like those people that feel they’re always alone but are constantly surrounded by people, I am. Ive tried to ask for help I really have but I mean, how much can I ask when nobody wants anything to do with me.

I’ve tried to kill myself once already last year, just woke up with an insane headache and threw up. My mother found a knife and notes under my bed, tried to get me a psych eval ONCE before giving up (I was too depressed to even get out of bed at that point). Asked about it a few months later multiple times, she said it cost money. (My parents aren’t poor at all) at some point I couldn’t stand to be touched by my mother in any capacity and would throw up after because it made me feel sick. Told somebody and they told me I was in the wrong because she’s my mother. I got addicted to Xanax last year, got off of it, withdrawals were insane. I almost failed **one** math test(which half the class failed and I got a 59) and my parents were berating me over the phone since they weren’t even in the country for like 2 months. I then tried Benadryl and whatever prescription I could find to get high since it was the only time my mind wasn’t working. I have 0 control over my life. I’ve tried literally anything near me to get a dopamine boost. (I don’t want to talk about it because I know how gross it is but I’ve had a porn addiction since I was 7)

As much as I want to think it’s going to get better, I know it’s not. Because even at times when my life is decent or going good nothing in my mind changes. Sometimes I feel like I’m on a high for just a bit, like I’m god, then it all comes crashing down again. I’ve always been depressed, this isn’t some one off thing because I had like a stupid highschool breakup. I know I sound like some stupid kid on here, I’m actually pretty “normal” looking as far as I can tell. Grades are all As. Been telling people I want to go to college and my plans for the future as if it isn’t to just kill myself as soon as I can get the chance again.

I was in a very bad mind space and neglected not just my teeth but my whole body/self. I hope u don't judge me.

Im worried, I certainly don't have the funds or anyone that can support me, Im anxious about going to the clinic afraid that the dentist might talk or judge me harshly or even scold me for neglecting my teeth.

I know it’s to fill a void cause I have plenty of clothes and clutter that would last for a lifetime. I feel like I’m just existing in the world and I don’t feel remotely alive. Ever since my dog passed, I’ve felt so empty. Sure I do laugh and have normal conversations with friends but deep down I don’t feel anything.

1luhqv2,I Hate This Life. Everyone Around Me Is Causing Me to Hate This Life.,"I'm sick of having to live like this. I can't even end matters because I'm too much of a coward to such things. My parent is selfish, my partner is in a situation, I'm in position where I'm unable to do anything and I hate this life.

Being the overprotected younger kid in the family, the elder one got away with everything; a social life, friends, outings, a wedding forgetting that I'm still waiting to be given in marriage, care, concern and everything.

My partner's siblings didn't accept our relationship in the beginning stages but now they've let my partner decide for himself but my parent being the parent that they are, is afraid to let me visit my partner even if they are unwell and does not want me to go live with my partner after marriage. I am caught up between these two and suffering a lot. I am not financially stable. I had to cancel my wedding and I am going through a lot. Nobody is understanding me. Everyone watches too many crime stories I believe that they keep bringing up stories adding to my parent's nightmares. My partner is the best I could ever ask for. I really want to visit them. To show that I care, not just virtually but in person too by just being there for them but I am unable to go against my parent.

I have no friends and no one to accompany me. No money to travel too. My partner offered to take care of the travel expenses but then again I am not allowed to travel on my own. I might be put in harm's way. I keep fighting with my partner who is extremely caring and patient with a person like me (not even visited them once in these 7 years).

I don't know what to do with my life. I sometimes feel to end everything. I can't deal with all this drama. Overprotective parent, a sickly partner who needs to be taken care of to recover quickly. A wedding that requires money. Me looking for jobs while having plans to have a career of my own but I have no motivation, energy, and I am always exhausted because of all the drama in my life.

When people are moving miles away to start a living why can't I go visit my partner who is just a one flight away. At least accompany me but no money for another ticket. All this is driving me crazy and sending me into depression once again.",1751957068.0,2,3
1luhq8r,Nothing going for me anymore,"I have almost completely lost hope in life. I want to kill myself most days now. I used to be a great person, very kind, social, smart, athletic, et cetera. I was top of my class and teachers said I had an insane amount of potential, encouraging me to apply to Ivy League schools in the future when I got to my senior year of high school. I was a dedicated varsity basketball player, beginning my journey as a young body builder, becoming very well tuned in business and statistics. The problem is and always has been the depression. My goals seem pointless as I want my life to end. My family is slowly turning on me, I have to testify against my mom for neglecting my siblings and I, my dad seems like he might go back to his more aggressive behavior towards me for the first time since he divorced my mom half a year ago, my dads side of the family is accusing me of horrible things just for their own entertainment, all of this crushing weight is on my shoulders as the oldest child in the family at 16. I don’t know who to trust anymore, I have no one to talk to. I used to be able to talk to my girlfriend, she would listen to me and she was actually very good at supporting me, but I ended up having to break things off with her because of her emotional manipulation and abusiveness towards me at times. Now shes spreading horrible rumors about me, the person I used to be able to trust so much seems like a complete stranger to me. I just found out that our whole relationship was based on a lie, as well. She lied to me about being a virgin and constantly lied to me about who she had dated and slept with in the past and I’m just now finding out and I feel so gullible for putting all of my trust in her. I just needed someone, and I really loved her, and I thought she was the most genuine and trustworthy person I’d ever met. It kinda feels like I had no clue who I was even dating at this point, a total stranger. Off the topic of her, my body building efforts were torn to pieces as soon as I started struggling getting out of bed, my grades and intelligence dwindled away with the less and less effort I found myself able to give, and my passion for basketball was just kind of gone. I can’t sleep most nights because of the thoughts I have at night; I’ve tried to take antidepressants but they make you feel like you’re not the real you anymore and honestly that’s torture. I have gotten so grossly fat that I hate to look at myself in the mirror anymore and recently have started starving myself. I waste my free time away in a job I despise for 40 hours a week and I just feel like a useless piece of shit. I can’t make myself to look forward to anything anymore, the only light in my life recently was falling in love with a girl that I will forever only be friends with because of the awful rumors being spread about us, and the fact that I’m so in love with her and can’t get rid of that feeling is torture as well. Anyway, I had high hopes for myself at some point in my life, it’s gotta count for something.

1luh8o6,I am not happy with my life,"I’m 21 m lately. Everything in my life has just been going wrong. I don’t even know. I’m posting this but I just wanted to put to talk about it. Recently, I went through a break up, but before that, I failed a Physical test ( I am in the military) so now I can’t go home for the summer. Missed my birthday with family. Which is fine. Not big of a deal. I know there’s many other people in the military. That don’t get to go home at all. How many people that end up getting broken up with the significant other. Besides, those things I had to move in with a roommate that I do. Not like it’s ok now. Job is probably the most boring job in the entire military. Where I’m station is not anywhere I want to be. I like the military, but I really don’t want to do another contract after this. I don’t know where or what I’m going to do when I get out. But I hope I make some sort of success. Also, part of me really does want my ex back. I say part of me, but it’s really all of me. Wants her back. I do talk to a therapist, and I go to the gym every day. I also get to go out on the weekends, and have had a few days off recently. Another thing that makes me unhappy  in life right now is how much I’m getting paid. It’s a long story, but basically I’m not getting paid the amount I should be getting paid because of a stupid situation. Occasionally on the weekends. I drowned myself with alcohol, but I can’t even do that anymore. Because my best friend got married, and I don’t hang out with him as much. And to be honest, I don’t know why I’m saying any of the stuff. It’s so minor, and there a lot of people that experience more things worse things than me. I just want to feel better. Trying hard to focus on myself and get over everything. But it’s hard and I really just wish I had her to talk to. And yes, my family is in contact with me, but I don’t talk to them as much because I feel like a failure. Into others. I just feel like a broken record. I do plan on going home soon. My ex says she wants to see me. I probably will. Just because she’s the best person I’ve ever met many people in my life. I’ve just been telling me to get over her and never looked back, but I feel like the only person that could tell me that it’s God himself. Speaking of God I do pray to him. I just feel like every time I pray to him. I’m asking him for something. What’s the time? I’m not even asking about myself and I’m just asking about others. Praying about my ex and my family. But recently I did pray about myself. I just prayed to him to take away my anxiety, my stressed. All my negative thoughts. I’ve felt depressed before, so it’s not really new to me, but I don’t think anyone likes the feeling. Thank you for reading. And if you comment, thank you for commenting. And to be honest, this is not that serious. I know it will pass, but I just wanted to put it out there. Thank you.",1751955099.0,1,0
1luh866,"I hate myself, feel like I’m not good enough, and struggle with comparing myself to others, and hate my room and my home. Some advice would be greatly appreciated 🤞🏻","For context I’m 17 yo and live in a standard suburban home. I’ve recently made plans to have my friend, and two others over for a sleepover. My house is not bad but it’s not as nice as my friend’s home that I’m having come over. My room isn’t decorated as nice as hers, but it’s not dirty or anything it’s just bare and boring. I have a bed, dresser, desk, and a rug that’s kind of cute. But it’s not as nice as her room. Plus I never have anyone over, reason one being because I am insecure that my house isn’t a new nice home like lots of peoples from school, and two because my room isn’t decorated fully. Due to this I have isolated myself from having friends, (for other reasons too) but mostly because I was worried they’d want to come to my house and I’m embarrassed and feel almost exposed like the person I am at school doesn’t match where I live, or like once someone sees my house and my room they won’t like me anymore. But I’ve had around 3 people over and they never thought differently of me. My ex boyfriend never thought anything negatively of my house. Anyways, I decided recently I’m done being insecure about my room and depriving myself of friends, so I invited my friend over this week. I’m still embarrassed though and severely nervous but I made a promise to myself that I would try to decorate my room before the day she comes, and now I’m super anxious about that.

Onto my friend- We’ve been friends for about a year now and we are now seniors in high school. She’s always been very kind, friendly, caring, attentive, confident, and extroverted. She lives in a very nice home in a newer neighborhood. I look up to her a lot, and feel weak to admit I do look up to her because of my age like I need to stop being childish and looking up to people? But I do, I wish I was like her. I’m not jealous of her but fairly envious. I’ll never be rude to her though just because she has things I don’t have, and I’ll always be happy for her if she is ever happy about anything. I’m also a good friend to her but I feel guilty that I envy her life, how great of a person she is, how nice her family and home is, and I wish I didn’t feel this way. I never want to be a bad friend to her and never will but I am willing to put my envy aside and just go with the flow when I’m around her. I’ve started comparing myself to her and everyone else I see at school or online and it sucks. I compare every aspect of myself to others and constantly tear myself apart, and my home to others homes. It makes me feel unworthy of everything and like I just need to isolate myself because I don’t deserve to live a happy life. I just want to be like my friend how she’s almost effortlessly cool and pretty. I feel so incredibly miserable, sorry if this isn’t something that big of a deal for this Reddit page but it’s really weighing heavy on me and I could use some advice.

1luh08x,18 years old and completely alone,"I’m 18 years old and i just got through my first year of college and honestly feel like shit. zero friends made am slowly outgrowing my old friends and am watching the girl i loved the most who was also my best friend slip right through my fingers. My friends all they want to do is drink, smoke, and that’s just not me. I stupidly confessed to my friend who I knew didn’t like me. I guess she got uncomfortable because while we tried to make things work and continue to be friends I can feel the shift. She was the only person I ever deeply connected to and felt like I could be myself around. Now she’s slowly pulling away, we used to talk everyday and all day but now it’s rare we even talk twice throughout the day. I’ve always dealt with a lot of mental issues built upon very poor and toxic family dynamics and a lot of pressure. I have a brother who is 2 years older and he’s attending a nearby university while i’m in community college hoping to transfer after my second year. He’s physically disabled and I have 2 older sisters with their fair side of mental disabilities. I am the only person without any physical or mental issues but I struggle a lot with feelings of sadness and anxiety. I used to self harm a lot back when I was 15 years old. The day my parents discovered they didn’t care. They were angry and told to me to commit if I was really that sad. It affected me a lot but I pushed through. I’ve had to deal with almost every major emotional distress alone without any real friends who cared. Now I’m dealing with a huge dilemma as whether to move when I transfer or to stay at our local university. Living at home is killing me. My parents are so toxic and have made my life so miserable. They’re the main reason for all of my personal issues and the way I am as of now. My brother also experiences some of it, just not as much as me as they go easier on him. He requires a lot of attention and requires lifting to be able to move to his like desk to his wheel chair to use the bathroom and to bathe. My dad basically works the entire day so I help my mom a lot with the carrying. It’s caused me a fair share of back problems and messes with my job as I’ll find myself in pain while working. I’ve been told this isn’t my burden or my duty but because I care so much for my brother I still feel like it is. I don’t want to leave him to deal with our horrible parents alone and leave my parents with the pain that comes with carrying him from place to place. I’m so alone. My “friends” all talk shit about me, the girl I loved is slowly fading, my home life is toxic and discouraging, and work and school is getting me nowhere. I feel like I’ve been constantly drowning with so much loneliness and heartbreak. All i’ve ever wanted was to fit in and find a group of people who truly cared for me and it’s like that’s too much to ask for. ",1751954202.0,1,1

 I would just like to say to those affected, who are also experiencing this illness, that you are not alone and that I understand your pain.

I feel alone, terribly alone and yet I don't have the strength to socialize with anyone, even if deep down I would like to join a support group, give love, receive it.

I am completely dead from the inside, on escitalopram, I only think about making cash to support my wife, my only ray of sunshine in this world that I hate.

I'm tired of trying, tired of dealing with rejection. I faced so much rejection from the professional IT world despite a master's degree and experience that I ended up opening my company.

I came to accept that maybe I was too different to have a normal place in the system, yet I love people, my family and my wife love me.

I have no hatred for anyone despite everything I have experienced which I will not state here out of modesty.

Ultimately this message is just a bottle thrown into the sea. Have a nice day.

PS: Diagnosed with severe depression since adolescence, I give the finger to a dying system that refuses difference despite what the media say. I'm going back to work on my company by writing partnership contracts to escape my demons.

I have a large group of friends and a loving family but it doesn’t feel like it. When I’m with my friends I feel like an outsider who doesn’t belong and when I’m home I miss my friends and feel like I’m losing them. That’s partially because I’m naturally bad at texting and because I broke up with my ex who is from the same place as them. I would often visit her and by extension them but without that I feel like I’m going to grow more and more distant until they aren’t my friends anymore.

I also miss her a lot, I recently found out she has a new bf and idk it brought back a lot of feelings which are getting to me. I miss her and wish I gave us more time. I often think about how I might meet her one day and we will just click again but I know that to be stupid and not something I should be thinking but I can’t stop.

1luee7g,"Not sure if I’m just lazy or if this is still depression, and I keep downplaying how bad my motivation is…","I’ve been on meds for anxiety and depression for a while now (Buspirone and Pristiq). They helped for a while, and I’m definitely not in a deep hole like I’ve been in the past. Because of that, I’ve kind of been counting my mood as a win like, “hey, at least I’m not falling apart.”

But even though I’m not totally spiraling, I’ve been really struggling with energy and motivation. I keep asking myself:
Is this just laziness? Or is this still part of my depression?

I want to do things. I care. I make plans. I think about what I need to get done. But when it’s time to actually do anything, I just… don’t. Not because I don’t want to. It’s like I physically and mentally can’t start. And then I beat myself up for it and start calling myself lazy or a failure.

I think I overlook how bad the energy/motivation side of things has gotten because I’m not in a full-blown depressive episode. Like, since I’m not crying every day or feeling hopeless, I almost gaslight myself into thinking I should be fine. But I’m not fine.

I have a doctor’s appointment coming up and I want to bring this up, maybe talk about adjusting meds or adding something that helps with drive and energy. Still, part of me feels ashamed for even saying all this out loud, like I’m making excuses. (not asking for medical advice)

(duh) But i don’t know if i can do it anymore, my pills are no longer working, my thoughts are getting louder and my parents aren’t helping. Today i got yelled at for feeling drained and not wanting to get up let me explain on what happened today.


So i’m in a bad mood cause my siblings, and yes i’ve been very drained for weeks now, but i did get up and clean a lot of my room that i can do, then ive took a break. I asked my step father for 2 days now to hang up my poster/banner cause he hasn’t stuck to his word. So he finally gets up to do it, then starts nit picking things about it, so i’m already feeling upset, and he’s lecturing me for no reason, yes it was still dirty but better than before. And then he’s like “look at him” and i tell him no cause im about to cry and i hate people seeing me cry, it makes me feel some type of way. He’s like “ok if you’re gonna give me attitude then you don’t need this” the rips my shit down, and lectures me how i’ve been bugging him for 2 days about this and how when they ask for stuff i don’t do it. Reminder i do not ask for a lot of stuff, i offer to do it instead of him, and clean around a lot, meanwhile my younger siblings are always asking for stuff. Then he says “you can have this up when you clean everything up” and storms out.

Then my mother walks in and starts yelling at me too after he left, i am crying while she yells at me, and i tell her “I am drained and im trying i really am!” She then continues on saying i’m not and i don’t do anything but sit on my phone. She told me that if my rooms isn’t clean tomorrow by the time she gets off work i lose everything and won’t get it back.

   This is very normal, my siblings cuss my parents out and acts out but when i have an attitude im suddenly terrible and just did the worst thing.

Sorry if this is long i just i’m so tired of it and need to get it off my mind, im so tempted just to give up n end it.",1751944880.0,1,0

I still will walk him even when I'm crying (I wear a hoodie and hope people don't call the cops or ask me if I need help like no leave me alone 🫠) I make sure he eats and gets treats and I play with him. I just feel so bad like right now I've been crying for a couple hours. I've ""talked "" to him about my depression I know he doesn't get it but I like to talk to him IDK why it comfortable to me and part of me thinks he understands.
He is the only reason I am still here. My mom wouldn't keep him she doesn't like him. And I can't have her put him to sleep or give him back to the shelter. I hope he doesn't wish he had a different owner.
He does comfort me and lay by me or me or will lock my face , bring me his toys! I just worry a lot...too much. I wish I could shut my head off and not think for a bit.
His name is Roger if anyone wants to know
He is 2 1/2

1ludeqy,Giving up at 32,"Hello. I feel like this is a safe space to let this out. I’ve never made a post before but I’ve always enjoyed reddit. I feel like giving up on life. Nothing is going right and I don’t even look forward to waking up because my life will be the same. I’m struggling in every aspect of my life and it’s come to the point where I don’t even have anyone to turn to anymore. It’s like I’m scared to die because no one will remember me. And it’s my sad reality. On top of depression, I’m bout to lose my apartment. I have been looking for a work from home job and it’s so impossible these days. My car is breaking down and I can’t even afford to get it fixed. My credit has been taking hits left and right and now I can’t even get approved for little things. I’m at the point where giving up is my only option. The more I reach out to resources, I’m leaving more empty than I felt before. I thought by now at 32, I would have a flourishing career. But I have nothing to my name but ppl who will only look at me and probably be ashamed of how I turned out. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. I was smart. I had ambition. I lost it all the older I became. Being a single mom hasn’t helped much either but thats the only reason why I’m still alive.

However I recently discovered she is still good friends with an ex hookup from a few years ago. At first I asked is he an ex she said he is a friend. I noticed phone calls from him before and after that question. Then I asked her again after i had wine is he an ex ? She said we just hooked up after my divorce. He helped me. She said He wasn’t even an option.  Again next day I gently asked Did you both want to be with each other ? She said yes but it wasn’t able to work out. I didn’t ask why it didn’t and I know she still cares for him. History or helping her and now he is reaching. Out for help and I think the bond is still good because she was very upset when I suggested they not communicate anymore. The later I said it’s ok you being have to that. This discussion occurred on Saturday 5th June. And today I still feel torn in my stomach. It’s shaking  and hurting. And I’m depressed and very lost in all my goals and dreams and no longer happy.

I love the people in my life and I’ve always offered myself as a shoulder to cry on, but I worry that I’m selfish for being that way. I’d hate to repeat the same motivational jargon, but sometimes it’s all I can do. I have a slight obsession with being that type of person, just good, helpful. It breaks my heart to think that I don’t mean the things I say, I think I do, but I’ll always doubt myself on that and whether what I say ever even does something.

1lucrdf,Am I in trouble/ should I seek help?,"I've been addicted to cutting for a little while now. I use a box cutter and I mostly cut on the inside of ny wrist but sometimes on my thighs aswell.

I don't really care about quitting because I feel pretty hopeless at this point but yesterday after I slit my wrist deeper than usual. I went to sleep after that. I usually sleep 12-ish hours on end but I woke up 3 hours after that due to a strong pain in my left arm.

I reckon I'm not very good at describing what the pain was exactly but it was more of an ache than a pain. It wasn't the actual wound that stung but everything from the elbow down hurt, including my hand and fingers.

I believe these are related. The ache has subsided slightly by the time i'm writing this. It still hurts and feels sore whenever I move it. I'm afraid I cut through some kind of nerve or vein.

I've never had something like this happen before so I'm wondering if anyone has experienced this and if I should be worried.

(I think this might matter in this context: The cut was vertical and right under the bulgy thing on the inside of your wrist, it was about 3.5cm long (1.4inches) and 1.5-2mm deep.)

1luche2,Life goes on...,"I turned 48 years old last month and am a total failure at life. The only thing I have achieved is to become human garbage. Something that only exists to be thrown away.

Within a calendar year both of my parents have passed way. In May my girlfriend was unfaithful and ended our relationship. Last week I was terminated from my job. I am human garbage that only exists to be thrown away. At this very moment there is only numbness. The lack of feeling.

I welcome this lack of feeling, because to feel is to hurt and who wants that? To feel is to be angry at those around me for the sin of being normal, happy, fulfilled, embraced. I can't see public acts of affection because it enrages me. I can't hear certain songs because  they remind me of a time I may have been happy, and also reminds me of what I lost and will never have again. I am a slave to my feelings and my pain. So this numbness is welcomed.

I don't know how much longer I have left. If God had mercy on me, I would have died of natural causes or a freak accident. Unfortunately I have been deemed unworthy of this mercy or there is no such entity that can grant this mercy. All I have is this numbness, this lack of anything that allows me to feel human. The alternative is to feel, to remember, to rage.

And what's the matter with rage? Its scary. It scares me because I don't want to hurt myself. But I may have to hurt myself so I don't hurt others. I can snap, or I can wither away in silence. Either way its better not to feel, its safe. Having nothing to live for is dangerous because it makes it easier to have things to die for. So this numbness is welcomed.

Whether I survive this moment or not, what does it matter? So what If I do myself in so I don't lash out? Reality always wins. There is no tragedy in the loss of a broken life. We can all be here today and gone tomorrow. In the end I'm just a random middle-aged man. If I make it, if I don't, who cares.

1lub6qm,Today was supposed to be the first day of a new therapist,"Brief history with therapy: I was with a therapist through my primary care provider from at least 2021 till February of this year. There were discussions of finding more long-term therapy and I found a therapist myself, and I was with him till May when he was suddenly no longer with the practice. I went back to my original therapist but there was obvious differences and I felt like there was definitely more support and breakthroughs with the one I switched to.

Anyways with some help I found another therapist at another practice and there was back and forth in regards to intake. I waited an hour through the appointment start time (all therapy has been done virtually FYI, and this appointment was confirmed to be virtual as well) and nothing, so I emailed the practice. They got back to me telling me they thought they created my profile and set me up and they apologized for it and tried setting me up with the therapist for next week, but I'm not going to go through with it.

1luag3l,Child of depressed parent,"I'm an adult child living with my mom. My mom appears to be depressed.

How do I help my mom? Or is it a lost cause?

I see support and understanding for people with narcissistic parents, or abusive parents, or maybe even chronically ill parents, but almost never depressed parents. It feels uniquely exhausting and hopeless. It really brings me down when I think about it. It also drives me absolutely crazy because there is no acknowledgement of how she might need help... we just go through life pretending it's normal that she has no hobbies, finds it difficult to contribute to housework, and spends hours watching TV after work. I mean, maybe she's burnt out and not depressed? But still, the effect is that her demeanor is down. She puts on a happy face for others but it is so obviously fake- since I've known her my whole life.

I'm rambling a bit because this is so hard for me to understand. It's been like this for basically my whole life, and we've blamed her chronic pain, but I truly have a feeling these issues are mainly from the brain, not just the body.

1lu9q2w,how to stop being negative,"so for starters ive been dealing with depressive disorder and anxiety for about 10 years and been through multitudes of things thats made me a very down person. i dont really know how to relieve stress and my life is incredibly stressful. family, work, struggling with myself, letting others issues become mine, etc. recently my boyfriend told me that my negativity is bringing him down and he hasnt said anything to me but has been feeling this way for a while. that its at the point that its making him not want to be around me. i really dont want that at all, i didnt realize i was over bearing in this type of way in our relationship, and though im glad he told me its making my anxiety go through the roof. he knows i deal with a lot, however he said he feels like i feel bad every day. truth be told i really do feel bad a lot of the time and i really am happy when im around him, my friends, and my cats. to my therapist ive expressed similar feelings that i dont want to feel like this to people and i notice that certain things i grew up hating about my mother are unfortunately imprinted on me. im desperately trying to unlearn how to be this way. im also very emotional which doesnt help. part of me does wish he understood a little bit more about me in dealing with depression (i.e negative self talk and motivation issues) but i cant convince someone of a subject they dont deal with. and it does suck a lot. i obviously know to “not take things too hard” and to “try to relax” but i have a brain that runs a million miles an hour and its not easy. i am starting taking my medication again (didnt have a psych for ab a year, finally got in touch with one after many failed connections) and really dont want to lose him this way",1751931658.0,1,1

I’ve had so many different jobs within the last 7 years and I feel like a failure. I can’t get the help I need without money, I can’t get money without a job and I can’t keep my job without getting the proper help I need.
Long story short, I had stopped seeing this psychiatrist I had from 13/14 years old to 20 years old. I started seeing him again around February of this year. In the appointments, he would tell me that I need to accept that I am a lazy person and that there is nothing wrong with me. even after all the diagnosis he had given me years ago.

It’s all been an endless loop. I feel like a burden to my partner, friends and parents. I have no idea what doing day to day and i burn myself out so quickly just trying to make it to the next day.
I just need a psychiatrist that will genuinely hear me out and to be able to afford it.

the past two weeks have just been me searching for new psychiatrists in my area. i’ve tried the few in my town that take my insurance before. the ones that are even an hour away don’t take insurance, payments consisting of $300-$400 just to get in and get an intake appointment.

Does any of you have a depressive significant other? How do you deal with it? How do you not let yourself get affected by it?

For context, my partner is currently an engineering student and he's been in college for almost six years now and he feels stuck. There's no assurance of when he'll graduate, and it is affecting him. I know it is selfish for me to say but it is also affecting me because of his suicidal thoughts, and I kept pushing him to seek professional help but he's more worried about what his family would say, or that he feels guilty to ask money to get therapy. I would get so frustrated because sometimes I feel like I am being his therapist, and I kept telling him I'm not always the best person to speak with when he's having a breakdown, I do not have the capacity to handle it properly, and when I say that he'll say things like ""That is so unfair, I'm the one who's going through something and I have to think about you, maybe you don't love me"" and that makes me feel more frustrated because I want to help him to get better but he just won't. He thinks more of what his mom would feel if she knew about it. Sometimes, it's become our reason to turn onto each other. I don't know how to help him, but I want to help him, I want him to be okay.

1lu8ibs,"Can't KMS due to guilt, so just stuck being depressed","TL;DR: Want to die but can't as feel too guilty. Would upset family. So I just self harm and hope I'll die in an accident or something so I can die and not feel guilty because I wasn't the one to kill me.

So I am 24 now and throughout my life sure there were a few good highlights, mostly when I was a kid and was young and carefree. Now I'm an unemployed graduate with a degree I feel is useless and whilst I got accepted into a masters I just can't be bothered to do it. It just doesn't seem like something I want to do but that's the issue I don't want to do anything.

There is the other issue, can't do nothing so easy suicide then. Unfortunately my feelings of guilt are too strong and I can't have my family have another kid die. I couldn't do that to them.

Now whilst I have friends I don't feel that close to them and my brain keeps telling me they hate me and if I could somehow get my brain to think that with my family I'd be golden because I'd be able to kill myself without the guilt of knowing I hurt someone.

I self harm regularly, small cuts and bruises on the arms and just keep jumpers on which I will challenging with the summer heat. So these days it's been more mental abuse I give myself than physical or I just try and do internal damage. I think I could die if it's not exactly by my hand, a car hitting me or unfortunately getting something terminal and just giving up.

I hate how selfish I am but I do want to die. I have no plans for the future, never did have a plan after childhood as I hoped something would have killed me by then.

I don't get it really. I have good parents and like my life was alright I just don't enjoy living. The highlights of my life are sleeping as I'm not thinking or using substances to turn my brain off for a bit. Basically if I don't have to think I'll be content. Unfortunately being in a coma would again make me feel guilty. It's selfish but I wish I didn't feel guilty about wanting to kill myself because I would have done it years ago during one of the many attempts that I chickened out of last minute because the guilt got to me.

1lu7ypo,Nervous system in crises,"Hi all,

I have chronic trauma from repeated abandonment in relationships. I also have a long history of depression and anxiety, which intensified during an abusive marriage.

Right now, I’ve noticed my fearful-avoidant partner pulling away again. I’ve reached out to him and I’m hoping for the best- but the pain and trauma feel unbearable. My nervous system is constantly on high alert.

At this point, my absolute priority is survival and stabilisation. I’m terrified of waking up tomorrow to this same level of pain. If there were a way to go into a medically induced coma for a few months, I would take it in a heartbeat.

My doctor has prescribed diazepam and propranolol, and has doubled my fluoxetine dose to 40 mg. I’m starting this treatment regimen tomorrow.

My goal right now is to reach a zombie-like state- to function for my son and for work. The alternative is too tragic to contemplate. I don’t want to die, but I’d rather die than live through months of this intensity. I can’t endure it.

So I’m asking for advice on the most effective numbing medications- anything that can get me through the next two to three months in a zombie-like, dissociated state. I’ll take all suggestions to my psychiatrist and use them responsibly. I’m not looking to abuse anything- just to survive.

Please don’t tell me to “sit with the pain” or “feel it.” I’ve felt enough pain to last a lifetime. Right now, I need numbing and functioning. That is my only focus.

Thank you so much.

1lu6fqy,advice on what to do with my life to make it less bad while i wait,"im waiting for university results come so i can see if entered or not, but that takes 6 days for each call so im gonna have to wait a while, meanwhile, i really dont know what to do, im 18 and i deal with deep depression since 13 and i have no friends, i really dont know what to do with my life and this constant agony of waiting and waiting keeps me bothered, some days i do some freelance at my dads job but thats until 12am after that im free, but being free isnt really a good thing since i have nothing in my life, i lost interest in playing games i liked long ago, im too bored and i have no motivation, theres nothing in my life that can give me even a temporary spark like some games i played before(celeste, undertale, minecraft, genshin impact) im also broke cuz i live in a 3rd world country and 5 of my currency equals 1 dollar, i tried cooking but i also lost sparkle on that.





can someone give one advice on a thing to do? or something that can give a temporary spark until i can finally see the results? (obs please dont suggest reading i have adhd and reading for me is an ass), i really wish i could just find something to not live in this stage of agony and self depreciation for not being good enough for a first call on uni.

1lu60aj,I'm depressed because i know i will never be who i was again,"Just wanted to vent...2 years ago i got a very good job as a flight attendant, good pay, good experiences, good friends, able to help my family, life was good finally after years of suffering (financially and emotionally). I got fired January last year, because of a mistake i made, and everything went to hell, i wasn't able to recover, i almost committed and suffered depression for months. Somehow maybe because of time, i got a little bit better but now i realized that i just pretended to forget but never healed. Truth is i am still unhappy, depressed and disappointed. My life got ruined also since i developed tinnitus because of listening to music with headphones and loud volume as a way to numb the pain. Like i said just wanted to vent and thank you if anyone read this! ",1751922278.0,3,1

1lu5ooq,Toxic friendships,"I have a friend group and that I was super happy to be in and it was very nice until a girl named serenity joined it and then everything for me went south. She would do and act in ways that I wasn’t cool with but I always brushed it off and did my own thing but I guess she didn’t like that and she eventually made it a big deal and telling everyone that I was mean to her, when in reality I was just saving my peace and choosing to leave it alone. After a while I finally opened up and stood my ground and for that everyone in the group wanted to kick me out so o got depressed because everyone I loved wasn’t on my side or caring about how them doing that made me feel. I chose to just walk away from the group but they didn’t stop after I did they reached out and told other friends I had that I was toxic, mean, two faced for leaving the group. It sucks because I’m trying not to let it get to me but it’s weighing down on me pretty hard because I cared about them. It just makes me feel like I should take myself out of this world.",1751921524.0,3,0

1lu5cmc,I broke with my girlfriend,"I broke with my girlfriend after ten years. I think that I have some kind of depression now and I feel that very long. I am ashamed of it because it’s about past - she has cheated on me ten years age - on the begging of the relationship when I was 18 and she was 16. But it was 2 of my friends (not in the same time) and that cus so deep that I am feeling it even now - I just couldn’t leave her because I love her - I thought that but maybe it was not love but something else, that I can’t name. I always felt like nothing, when something happy occurred to me I always felt that in my head. I just feel guilty because I didn’t want it sooner but I just couldn’t do it. Because of that I wasn’t have self respect, my only choice was to end with myself ( but I will never do it, I just thought about that)or live that - I felt it that way. I felt that in so many years, that I numb my pain, I was always hiding my emotions, I couldn’t numb the pain. Now I don’t think about killing myslef but I just feel so low , I feel like I won’t meet anyone because I am so scared about that and even if I meet someone that I will be hurting her - for example in controlling, jealousy etc. finally she broke up with me and don’t want to make it better it’s just get worse. Now I am smoking a lot of cigarettes, eat very small - and she still lives with me because she is looking for a flat. I just feel like I am nothing ",1751920759.0,5,4

But psych wards terrifies me, I don't think I could handle staying somewhere other than my bedroom, and not being able to go out (having the freedom of wandering around is probably the only thing keeping me sane arm). I already went to the hospital once (suicide ""attempt"") and the doctors where waiting to transfer me to a mental hospital, and this was the most stressful day of my life (I never cried so hard and never had so many suicidal and sh thoughts). And even, my experience with psychiatrists lead to nowhere and nothing gets better with them, only worse.",1751920478.0,6,4

1lu4odf,Depression to the point of isolation,"It's kinda of a weird contradiction. As someone who is clinically depressed, ideally you want to talk to someone to let them know what you're going through.

I was not asking for help for my mental health for quite a long time. But I realized that I couldnt go on like that anymore, so I reached out and told some people about my situation.

Still no one is asking about how I'm doing, and that kinda hurts. It's like my mental health battle is too much for other people. As soon as they find out, they get away from me.

And that has exacerbated my situation and I've gone into an extreme self isolation. Needless to say that does not help me at all. I only have more time to drown in my thoughts and continue the silent battle in my head. It feels like I'm a burden to all the human beings around me, so I don't bother anymore.",1751919209.0,18,14
