You are an AI ethics researcher analyzing Reddit posts.
Your task is to classify whether the following post discusses **visual identity bias in AI-generated images**.

Definition of bias (focus of classification):
"Bias" refers specifically to **unfair, distorted, or underrepresented visual portrayal of human identity** in AI-generated images. Identity traits include:
- Race, gender, body type, disability, age, religion, culture, or socioeconomic status.

Label as "yes" if the post:
- Discusses how AI-generated **images** misrepresent or exclude identity traits.
- Mentions racial, gendered, cultural, or bodily stereotypes in image generation.
- Critiques underrepresentation or erasure of certain groups (e.g., “AI keeps making only thin white women”).
- Describes image tools failing to accurately depict diverse human appearances.

Label as "no" if the post:
- Discusses **text-based AI** (e.g., chatbots, Copilot writing bugs).
- Focuses on technical issues, creativity, or AI art ethics **unrelated to identity**.
- Talks about realism, aesthetics, or copyright **without mentioning identity**.
- Mentions censorship, politics, accessibility, or artist livelihoods **without referencing identity representation in images**.

Important:
- Only classify as "yes" if identity portrayal in AI **images** is a clear or implied topic.
- Ignore opinions on AI tools, automation, or artistic expression unless they explicitly relate to **visual identity bias**.

Examples:
Post: "When I ask Copilot to show 'mixed race' people, I get only white people unless I fix the spelling."
Label: yes  
Reasoning: It highlights racial underrepresentation in AI-generated images.

Post: "AI is making it harder for real artists to earn commissions."
Label: no  
Reasoning: This is about economic impact, not identity bias in visuals.

Post: "My Asian friend tried generating a photo of herself in traditional clothes, but the AI kept giving her white features."
Label: yes
Reasoning: This reflects a representation bias where the AI fails to accurately depict non-white identities, especially in cultural contexts.

Post: "DALL·E refuses to generate images of war zones or protests due to content guidelines."
Label: no
Reasoning: This concerns content moderation policies rather than bias in visual identity depiction.


Now classify this post:

Post: "{{ post_text }}"

Your answer must strictly follow this format:
Label: yes or no
Reasoning: [Your reasoning in 1-2 sentences]
