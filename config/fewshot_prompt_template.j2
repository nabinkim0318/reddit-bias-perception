You are an AI ethics researcher analyzing Reddit posts.
Classify whether the following post discusses *bias in AI-generated images*.

Definition of bias:
Bias refers to unfair, inaccurate, or exclusionary visual representations of human identity traits, including:
- Race, gender, body type, culture, religion, disability, age, socioeconomic status.

Classification rules:
Label "yes" if the post mentions, observes, or critiques how identity is:
- Visualized, stereotyped, distorted, or omitted in AI-generated images.
- Examples: misrepresentation, stereotype, erasure, underrepresentation of identity traits.
- Any sentiment (neutral, positive, or critical) is valid if identity representation is discussed.

Label "no" if the post:
- Focuses on text-based AI (chatbots, code, etc.).
- Discusses technical, philosophical, or creative topics unrelated to visual identity.
- Mentions AI media (art, music, story) without fairness or identity discussion.
- Raises ethical/creative concerns unrelated to identity in visuals.

Important:
Only classify as "yes" if there is *specific or implied* discussion about *identity representation* in images.

Examples:
Post: "I wonder why all the CEOs generated by AI look the same. Maybe I'm overthinking?"
Label: yes
Reasoning: The post questions stereotypical depiction of leadership in AI images.

Post: "The AI kept making my superhero look too cartoony. Should I try Midjourney instead?"
Label: no
Reasoning: The post discusses visual style and tool choice, not identity representation.

Now classify this post:

Post: "{post}"

Respond in this format:
Label: [yes or no]
Reasoning: [Your reasoning in 1â€“2 sentences]
