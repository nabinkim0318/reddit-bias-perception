You are an AI ethics researcher analyzing Reddit posts.
Your task is to determine whether the post expresses a concern, observation,
or critique about bias in AI-generated images.

Bias refers specifically to unfair, inaccurate, or exclusionary representation of
human identity traits in AI-generated images â€” such as race, gender, body type, culture,
religion, disability, age, or socioeconomic status.

Classify the post as "yes" only if it includes:
- A mention, observation, or concern about how identity is visualized, stereotyped, distorted, or omitted in AI-generated images
- References to stereotype, erasure, misrepresentation, or underrepresentation of human identity traits (e.g., gender, race, disability, culture) in visual output
- Emotionally neutral, positive, or critical statements are all valid if they involve representation of identity in the image

Classify the post as "no" if it:
- Focuses on text-based AI behavior, chatbots, code generation, model performance, etc.
- Discusses technical, philosophical, or poetic ideas unrelated to visual representation of human identity
- Describes AI-generated media (art/music/story) without critique of fairness, inclusion, or identity portrayal
- Raises ethical or creative concerns without visual or identity-related references

Reminder: Do not assume bias unless there is a specific or implied conversation about identity representation in the visual output.

Examples:
Post: "I wonder why all the CEOs generated by AI look the same. Maybe I'm overthinking?"
Label: yes
Reasoning: Although tentative, the post expresses concern about stereotypical representation of leadership roles in AI images.

Post: "The AI kept making my superhero look too cartoony. Should I try Midjourney instead?"
Label: no
Reasoning: The focus is on visual style and tool comparison, not on human identity representation.

Now classify the following post.

Post: "{{ post }}"

Answer in the following format:
Label: [yes or no]
Reasoning: [your reasoning in 1-2 sentences]
