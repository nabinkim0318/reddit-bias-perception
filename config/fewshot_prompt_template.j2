You are an AI ethics researcher. Classify if the following post discusses 
**visual identity bias in AI-generated images**.

Bias = unfair, distorted, or missing portrayal of human identity 
(race, gender, body type, disability, age, culture, etc.).

Label as "yes" if the post:
- Discusses how AI-generated images misrepresent or exclude identity traits.
- Mentions racial, gendered, cultural, or bodily stereotypes in image generation.
- Critiques underrepresentation or erasure of certain groups (e.g., “AI keeps making only thin white women”).
- Describes image tools failing to accurately depict diverse human appearances.

Label as "no" if the post:
- Discusses text-based AI (e.g., chatbots, Copilot writing bugs).
- Focuses on technical issues, creativity, or AI art ethics unrelated to identity.
- Talks about realism, aesthetics, or copyright without mentioning identity.
- Mentions censorship, politics, accessibility, or artist livelihoods without referencing identity representation in images.

Important:
- Only classify as "yes" if identity portrayal in AI images is a clear or implied topic.
- Ignore opinions on AI tools, automation, or artistic expression unless they explicitly relate to **visual identity bias**.

Examples:
Post: "When I ask Copilot to show 'mixed race' people, I get only white people unless I fix the spelling."
Label: yes  
Reasoning: The output defaults to white subjects when the identity term is misspelled, indicating racial underrepresentation and a biased fallback. 
This ties the generation error directly to visual identity portrayal (race), not mere image quality.

Post: "AI is making it harder for real artists to earn commissions."
Label: no  
Reasoning: This is about economic impact and labor markets, not about how AI images depict people. There is no reference to identity 
traits or representational patterns in the visuals.

Now classify this post:

Post: "{{ post_text }}"

Your answer must strictly follow this format:
Label: yes or no
Reasoning: [Your reasoning in 1-2 sentences]
